*Editor’s note: This is the first installment of a three-part series on eating disorders.*

Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and overeating are the "major" eating disorders that can make students feel alienated from their peers and families. The constant cycle of lying about what they eat and what they do with the food after they eat it can take a toll on how students feel about their relationships, their commitment to school and how they view themselves.

As part of February’s eating disorders awareness month, Lamar faculty and students have come forward to explain what goes on behind an eating disorder, how it affects its host and how food becomes a powerful way to control the underlying problems causing the disorder.

Amy Shows, family and consumer sciences department chair, teaches an eating disorders course for graduate students.

"One of the things we do in the class is go through the major eating disorders, which are of course anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, and there's this category called EDNOS, Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified," Shows said. "If a physician, nurse practitioner or psychologist was trying to diagnose whether or not someone has anorexia or bulimia, there are these clinical diagnostic criteria that would be individually looked for."

The criteria come from the DSM-IV, the diagnostic statistical manual that is used for other mental health issues. A person must fit all of the criteria to be diagnosed as anorexic or bulimic. If a person only fits some of the criteria, or has otherwise "abnormal" eating habits, such as chewing food and then spitting it out, then she or he falls into the EDNOS category.

Cynthia Ksiazek, student health center counselor, said it's not unusual for someone to go through many of the behaviors of anorexia, bulimia and overeating before choosing one disorder.

"People often use all of those," she said. "They may not be all at once, but I have known people, for example, that will restrict their calories or eating, but at the same time may be binge-eating, purging or might be engaging in excessive exercise. Exercise, when excessive, is a form of purging."

The eating disorders course teaches students about signs and symptoms of both "major" and "minor" eating disorders and how to recognize "high-risk" individuals.

"Research shows us that certain sects of a population do appear to have higher prevalence rates," Shows said. "You can look at the prevalence rate of binge-eating, anorexia or bulimia on a campus setting, and it will be a certain number. But if you decided to just look at female athletes, spirit team members, high school cheerleaders, drill team members or models, it \(will probably be higher\). Because people spend so much time looking at them, that's going to perhaps trigger an eating disorder or put someone at a high risk for an eating disorder."

A common misconception, Shows said, is that eating disorders only affect females. She said that celebrities and the media may have an effect on how women open up about their disorders.

"I think it kind of started when Karen Carpenter died," she said. "It was very shocking to the nation, and I think her death has been one of the things that has helped anorexia nervosa kind of become a household term. No one had really heard of it, and then bit by bit, different celebrities began to say 'I struggle with this' or 'I've struggled with it.'"

She said that because young adults look up to celebrities as role models, they may be trying to participate in the "glamorous disease" to be more like those they admire. Ksiazek said that another reason it's viewed as a feminine issue may be because women generally open up about their thoughts and feelings more than men.

Shows teaches about the different treatment options for people with eating disorders and what is required of the "disordered person" for their treatment to be successful. Most of the students who take it are looking to be nutritionists or dietitians, she said.

"I think for treatment to be successful, the person has to want it," Shows said. "Some people with eating disorders are comfortable with the eating disorder, and they really are not looking to get over it or get through it. They are comfortable living with it. If I have a friend, daughter, sister, or whatever with an eating disorder, and they don't see it as a problem, there's probably not a whole lot that I will be able to do. When the individual realizes, 'I need help with this,' that's when they're more successful."

Ksiazek feels that there's a role for nutritionists and counselors to work together in order to best treat someone with an eating disorder.

"I would think that each has a role with helping the person regain their health," she said. "The nutritionist will very likely help with calorie intake, talk about healthy foods, possibly talk about the vitamin and mineral content of food and come up with healthier eating patterns.

"Counselors help identify the issues that precipitated their disorder, like post-traumatic stress disorder and abuse. It's all under the umbrella of mental health. When people are having severe psychiatric issues, they turn to these disorders in their minds as a means for coping, and it's unhealthy coping. We have to teach people healthy coping skills for the issues that they're confronted with."

Shows has a handout for her class that lets people know when they're becoming "part of the problem" and "part of the solution" in helping their loved ones.

"You're part of the problem if you attempt to punish, threaten, bribe or preach," Shows said. "Avoid emotional appeals, because that increases feelings of guilt with the other individual. Also you’re a part of the problem if you cover up or make excuses for the eating-disordered person. If you argue with the person about how much they should eat or shouldn't eat, that's generally not helpful and can just make the problem worse."

Being part of the solution includes understanding the disorder, attending support groups, and trying to help their loved ones find the best treatment, Shows said.

"We want to offer as much encouragement and support as possible," Ksiazek said. "Loved ones need to educate themselves and help them get treatment. I would recommend that they gently present their observations or why they think \(their loved one\) has an eating disorder, and try to get that person to share and have a conversation about it. They need to support them as a friend or family member and also help find appropriate treatment to get help."

Ksiazek said that she encourages students to get evaluated at the health center in case their issues extend beyond an eating disorder.

"We want to get to the underlying psychological issues and emotional issues that coexist with this," she said. "There may be correlations between PTSD and abusive issues with eating disorders, much like depression and anxiety issues; it's how \(the events\) are manifested. It may start out innocently enough about weight management, but it may manifest itself from there."

She said that any student who feels that they, or someone they know, have an eating disorder should make an appointment at the health center to see one of the counselors or a nurse practitioner.

"We want people to learn healthy attitudes about body image, food, what a healthy weight would be for their size and frame, what is healthy for them and how to take care of themselves," Ksiazek said. "We want people to learn a healthy balance of eating, exercise and self-esteem."

Both Ksiazek and Shows said that they want students to know that there is hope for students suffering from eating disorders and that the health center is a good resource to start seeking help. For more information, contact the Student Health Center at 880-8466.
