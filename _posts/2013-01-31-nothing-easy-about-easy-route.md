Forty years ago, this country took a tremendous stride toward women’s rights. Forty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a right to privacy under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman’s decision to have an abortion.

Forty years ago, the ruling of Roe v. Wade changed, and divided, this nation.

Jan. 22 marked the anniversary of this landmark trial. Celebrations thus far have been sparse, while protests and marches against the 1973 ruling have been prevalent.

Now for those of you who slept through most of your history classes, allow me. Roe v. Wade is without a doubt the single-most referenced court case when it comes to abortion rights. This case is the reason abortion is "accessible" today.

In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman could, and should, have the ability to decide whether or not she wanted to continue a pregnancy. However, the justices did factor in viability, meaning the unborn child is "potentially able to live outside the mother’s womb, albeit with artificial aid." Up until the child is viable, the mother can have an abortion. After the child is viable, abortion becomes the doctor’s decision. Usually, it is reserved to protect the life of the mother, with some exceptions.

Although Roe v. Wade made history, I had limited knowledge of it until a few years ago. Being raised in the South, the only thing I knew about abortion was that it was "wrong." We are, as you know, in the Bible Belt. Abortion may be legal, but it is by no means out in the open. Many women view it as something for the promiscuous, the irresponsible, the poor — and minorities.

The nation is so divided on where life begins that we have forgotten about the women who must choose whether they will continue a pregnancy or not. These are real women and they don’t deserve to be labeled as "murderers" for doing the best they can in a difficult situation.

When a woman finds out she’s pregnant, as the law stands now, she has three options — abortion, adoption or motherhood. As a woman who’s been in this situation, this decision requires some thought. It is our responsibility as women and potential mothers to decide what is best for us — and our children.

Two weeks before I started college, I went to a clinic. I was around eight weeks pregnant — 18 years old — and I just knew that something was wrong with my baby. For weeks, I couldn’t stop throwing up. I was losing weight, and something was just not right. When I found out I was pregnant, I considered abortion and adoption, but ultimately I decided to keep my baby.

I will never forget that day in the clinic. I was in my room, sweating through my gown, periodically throwing myself over the bed to vomit in a trash can they had set up for me.

"How attached are you to this child?" a nurse asked.

My heart stopped. I threw up again and asked, "Why?"

"Your baby is dying — and it’s killing you," she said, never making eye contact with me.

I wasn’t allowed to look at the ultrasound — wasn’t allowed to look at my child — while they spouted off medical terms and tried to explain to me that my baby would be dead within the week, and if I waited to miscarry naturally, I would soon follow.

They gave me my options. I could either miscarry naturally in my home and probably die there. I could go to a hospital and wait to miscarry so that they could intervene when my heart started failing. I could go home and take an abortion pill to speed up the process and — possibly — survive. Or, they could remove the baby, today, in the clinic and I would live.

I spent an hour and a half, sitting in their waiting room with a trash can by my side, deciding what I should do.

Any woman who has ever had a miscarriage knows it is not an experience you would ever want to repeat. It feels like your body is trying to tear itself apart, and you are certain that you are going to die. Even if you miscarry in a hospital, there are not enough drugs in the world to dull that kind of emotional pain.

So that day in the clinic, I decided to have an abortion.

Depending on what trimester you’re in, abortions fall under three categories — D&C \(dilation and curettage\), D&E \(dilation and evacuation\), and D&X \(dilation and extraction\). Since my baby had stopped developing within its first four weeks, it was small enough to use the first-trimester abortion — the D&C, which involves dilating the woman, like you would for a pap smear, and then suctioning out her uterus.

It is not a pleasant experience. And it will come back to haunt you every time you visit an OB/GYN in the future.

Now there will be some sympathizers to my story that say, "Well, you didn’t really have an abortion. Your baby was dying," and believe me, I appreciate that you see it that way. Because doctors do not. Every doctor visit, including dental checkups, requires answers to the same three questions: How many pregnancies have you had? How many abortions have you had? How many children have you had?

I have yet to find a doctor who cares about why a woman had an abortion. It is unbelievable how much judgment is passed from doctor to patient based on those three questions. I have switched doctors more times than I can count because of insensitive comments I have received from medical examiners and personnel.

"Every child is a blessing." "Every child is a gift from God." "Oh, you went the easy route."

Abortion is never an easy route. It is the most difficult decision a woman will ever make. And as a society, we must learn that not every woman who has an abortion decided to have one just because she didn’t "want" her baby.

I have yet to meet a woman who has had an abortion, and I have met several in this area, because she didn’t want her baby. These women loved their babies. But their individual circumstances forced them to make a difficult decision.

I don’t think that every "pro-life" subscriber should abandon their beliefs. On the contrary, I admire your drive to picket and protest when it comes to something you believe in. I feel the same way about gay marriage, gun control, civil liberties and women’s rights — including birth control and abortion. All I want is a little more understanding.

We are not "baby killers," "irresponsible," "sluts," or whatever other label society feels like throwing at us. We are women. We are your neighbors, your family, your co-workers, your classmates and your friends. We exercised our right to privacy, as defined by Roe v. Wade 40 years ago, and our rights as women to decide what was best for us — in that moment. We deserve your understanding and your love just as much as anyone else.

It is time we come together as a nation on the issue of abortion. It has nothing to do with whether or not you personally want one. It has to do with letting your neighbor make that choice for herself — a choice that may just save her life.
