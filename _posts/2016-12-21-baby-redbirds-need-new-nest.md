When it comes to higher education funding, state budget cuts are a difficult topic.

No one really wants to take responsibility for deciding which programs get cut, which departments lose the most money, or which services students will no longer benefit from. No one wants to receive angry letters or phone calls from students and employees, asking "Why us?"

And rightfully so. Honestly, if I were in that position, I wouldn’t want to take responsibility either. However, newspapers believe in bylines, meaning the reader will always know which reporter is responsible for what. I don’t have the luxury to hide.

By now you’ve probably guessed that I’m a little peeved about something we’ve lost on campus. Since I don’t know who is responsible, or more likely the group responsible, I’d like to use this space as an open request.

Bring back campus day care. Your students are suffering.

In late March of 2011, I found out I was pregnant. Quite honestly, I wasn’t sure what to do. A recurring thought was, "Will I be able to stay in school?"

Thanks to Lamar’s then-available Early Childhood Development Center, my answer was, "Yes." I called the center the day after I found out I was expecting.

A very polite woman on the phone informed me that everything would be OK. The ECDC was there to help moms stay in school. They mainly watched 3- to 5-year-olds, but the lady said accommodations were possible for younger children. On that day in March 2011, the center had a substantial waiting list. They didn’t have a foreseen opening until May 2012.

I was due in November, so that left me six months uncovered as far as childcare. Could I afford to take a semester off? Would I come back to school if I did take a semester off? Could I afford, financially, to pay someone to watch my son for six months? Would my mother, who watches my niece, be able to watch my son for those six months? What to do?

I thanked the woman for the information and decided when I was ready to tell my mom, I would ask her about watching my child until the center had an opening. Thankfully, when we had that conversation, my mother said, "Absolutely."

I was officially back on track to continuing my education once my child was born — a great, care-free state for a pregnant woman.

Then, on Nov. 16, 2011 — the day I went into labor with my son — the university announced that the ECDC would be closing in May 2012, the same month I was told they would have an opening.

Just for your information, that is not the news you want when you’re so close to your due date. I’m not saying it’s the reason I went into labor, but with all the other stress I was under that day, that little bombshell did not help.

The ECDC served Lamar faculty, staff and students — and the outside community — for 25 years.

Lamar should have done something.

We are under great financial strain from the state, and no one is feeling these effects more than university students. Nearly every semester, our tuition and fees increase while our services seem to decrease. 

I understand that not everyone needs childcare. And I don’t think that everyone should have to pay for campus childcare. I would just like for the university to consider a parent’s needs just as much as they consider an athlete’s. Yes, I said it.

Somehow, every student pays an athletics fee that we can’t opt out of even if we know we will never attend an athletics event. I’m all for utilizing the services that I pay for — but I have absolutely no interest in sports. It’s nothing personal. They just aren’t my thing.

Yet a service I would gladly pay to have — and pay extra to have — I had no say in. This is an embarrassment, and I take it as a personal insult.

Luckily for me, I’ve worked out an arrangement with my mother and she has been able to continue watching my son for me — well past the six-month mark we had originally discussed. The key word there is "luckily."

If anything happens to my mother that makes it impossible for her to watch my son before I graduate, I will not graduate. There will be no chance for me to return to school before he starts kindergarten, and by that time, I’ll probably have given up on getting my degree.

Lamar needs a child day-care service. We had a really good program going, and we just let it go because we let money become more important than our children.

Nothing is more important than our children. I’ve got my "baby redbird," and he deserves a nest.
