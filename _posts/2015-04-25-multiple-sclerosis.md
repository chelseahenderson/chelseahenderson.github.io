The casual onlooker might not think anything is amiss with Cecelia Johnson.

The Houston artist is tall, lean and pale — reminiscent of a high-fashion model. Her hardened eyes hint that she has a story, a pain, a life experience far beyond that which her 34 years suggest.

But outside observers can only guess what that story might be and what her experience has been.

What they won’t see is the debilitating, relentless disease she braces herself against every day. It’s invisible, which makes it infinitely worse to bear.

"My whole life is just scrambling from one place to another trying to get help — trying to live," Johnson says in a Nov. 12 YouTube video. "I haven’t *lived* in so long."

The Hot Springs, Ark. native’s life took a turn for the worse on Sept. 18, 2001 — exactly a week after the 9/11 terror attacks. She was 22 years old.

"The weekend after 9/11 was a traumatic, out-of-body experience — for everyone," Johnson said. "My friend and I took off on a road trip, just to get away, and I hit my head very hard. As the weekend progressed, my left eye was slowly getting tighter and tighter, and it was so painful. I couldn’t even open my eyes."

Johnson, then a junior art student at Lamar University, returned to Beaumont and admitted herself to St. Elizabeth’s emergency room. The nurses told her to take some Tylenol and call her regular physician if her pain worsened.

"The ER doctor wasn’t taking me seriously, so I went to my doctor in Houston and said, ‘Look, this is really bad. Something’s going on,’" she said. "They did a CAT scan, which caused him enough concern to do an MRI."

Johnson’s MRI led to a spinal tap and a one-week hospital stay.

"I had no idea what was happening to me," she said. "I was ready for someone to give me medication and send me home. I’d never been sick before. I kept thinking everything would be OK."

Johnson found herself staring at images of her brain on a hospital light-board.

"It was strange looking at my brain," she said. "Think about it — 9/11 had just happened, and a neurologist is showing me my brain scans, which I had never seen before."

The neurologist explained that Johnson had an inflamed optic nerve causing her eye pain, but that they also found "white matter lesions."

"He said, ‘What that means is either you’re a 70-year-old chain smoker or you have AIDS.’ I was just like, ‘What the hell is option three?’ I was very angry. You don’t joke about that stuff — not even for a second."

Then the doctor said, "Or you have multiple sclerosis."

"Is that worse than AIDS? Really? Am I dying?" Johnson thought.

"My mom was over there crying, because when she was young, MS was a killer — it was terminal," she said. "It’s still terminal. The illness is terminal. It shortens your life — a lot.

"It’s just seen so casually these days. Even the doctor said, ‘Of all the degenerative diseases to get, you got the good one. You got the easy one.’

"My whole concept of self, my personality — everything changed that day. And it’s never been the same. I lost 22 years of my life before then. I don’t remember half of it. I was thrown into a very surreal world that just kept going from then on."

Johnson’s diagnosis has led her down a metaphorical rabbit hole of specialists, prescriptions for medications she calls "cases of death," and a sobering look into the country’s medical system.

"I had to battle doctors for years," she said. "Neurologists are all paid by the pharmaceutical companies, but I didn’t know that then. You don’t want to believe these things. You don’t want to believe all the conspiracy theories. But some things are not conspiracy theories at all — they’re facts.

"I looked at it like, ‘Facts. Logic. I can do this. I can figure this stuff out.’ At every turn, they’re telling me, ‘I don’t know. See a psychiatrist. You’re crazy. You’re imagining things. You’re a woman. You’re pretty. You’re not getting enough attention.’ I have heard it all — from medical professionals.

"It took several years of my life to become proactive — for things to shift. It took trial and error, and basically being slapped in the face by every doctor, by the MS Society, you name it. They don’t even know what MS is, let alone what to treat it with."

The National Institute of Health defines multiple sclerosis as an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, most commonly through the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The term comes from multiple scleroses, or multiple scars, that form throughout the central nervous system.

Johnson has major concerns with her "diagnosis."

"MS is just a symptom," she said. "We’re all trying to fight this symptom that doctors tell us is a diagnosable disease, which it’s not. There’s no way to ‘diagnose’ MS except with an MRI where you can see the lesions, the scars, on my brain. If you have lesions, you have MS.

"It’s a catch-all diagnosis. It’s like saying, ‘What do you want for dinner?’ and answering, ‘Food.’ MS is just a bunch of stuff that they don’t know. They don’t even know the origin of the disease. 

"I have a chronic, debilitating neurological disease, which is also physical, with no known origin. It’s completely unpredictable. Anything can happen. And I have to live with all of that."

Through her quest for knowledge about her condition, Johnson said she has found an intentional effort between doctors, pharmaceutical companies — "Big Pharma" — and the Federal Drug Administration to keep the general population confused and misinformed.

"There’s a reason why MS is downplayed so much — because it’s just a symptom of very serious illnesses," she said. "We’ve all been categorized by the medical world, by everyone who’s making the money. They have given us a category to throw us in because they don’t know what to do with us. They don’t know how to explain it to us, but they want to make money.

"They just want to keep people thinking, ‘You have MS,’ and those people think they have a manageable disease that there is medication for. I was on injections to suppress my immune system. If I have an autoimmune disease, isn’t suppressing my immune system the last thing you want to do? There are a lot of people that are starting to do that now — blowing that umbrella off and saying, ‘We all need to join here.’ All of the ‘orphans’ are coming together, because MS is an orphan disease. We are completely on our own."

Orphaned and alone, Johnson faced a never-ending series of "brick walls" in the United States, which inspired her to seek alternative medical help.

In 2005, she heard about stem cells — unspecialized cells that are capable of renewing themselves and that can be induced to become tissue- or organ-specific cells with special functions.

There are two basic types of stem cells — embryonic and adult. Embryonic cells have been called "the master cells" because of their potential to become any cell. Adult cells, however, cannot become any cell. Their primary function is to maintain and repair the tissues in which they are found.

With lesions eating away at her brain, Johnson locked onto the idea of repairing her central nervous system and, hopefully, restoring some of her most basic functions. 

She began looking for doctors offering stem cell transplants, and in 2007, she went to Tijuana, Mexico, where an American doctor was offering donor stem cells extracted from umbilical-cord blood.

"My mom and I found Dr. Frank Morales on the Internet," Johnson said. "It was about $15,000, which was cheap for the time. I went to see him the following two years. They just took the stem cells, separated them from the blood and combined it with my plasma so \(the cells\) could acclimate themselves to my body before they were infused to my vein."

Johnson said the three infusions made living with MS much more manageable, controlling the inflammation and keeping her at a "maintenance level."

Then the FDA got involved.

"They put my doctor in prison — ruined his life," Johnson said. "They took away his livelihood, his reputation, everything. They claimed that he was pedaling unproven, untested stem cells. Stem cells he was getting from cord blood — so, placentas — the waste product of birth. I still have to explain to people, ‘No babies died in the making of these stem cells.’"

Without her yearly infusions, Johnson’s condition steadily declined. She soon lost her ability to walk — or even stand — unassisted.

"Most people with MS have given up," she said. "They’re at home, invalid. They don’t have a life. They’ve given up their independence, their privacy. They’re in pain, and they can’t do anything for themselves.

"That’s the place I was in. I could not leave home without a walker or wheelchair for almost two years. My muscles were just so very weak. It’s painful — very painful — like when your leg goes dead and tries to get blood back 24/7. It still comes and goes, and always will. I just don’t go down easy — so I started screaming."

Johnson was desperate for relief. Then she heard about Celltex Therapeutics, a new Houston company that multiplied and stored adult stem cells.

"I started looking at every angle for me to get stem cells, because I knew that they had helped me," she said. "And here they were, finally, being legalized and used for the first time in the United States, right here in Houston. It was exciting."

Celltex was offering stem cell treatments as part of a clinical study — at $30,000 per person — and unexpected names were on the list of patients. Texas Republicans, Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Rick Hardcastle, were already customers, as well as Celltex co-founder Stanley Jones.

Skeptical but hopeful, Johnson raised the money.

She went in for a "mini-liposuction procedure," in which Celltex took adipose tissue from her stomach in order to extract stem cells and then multiply them. She was told it would take six to eight weeks for her cells to be ready.

In October 2012, four days before her scheduled treatment, the FDA shut Celltex down. Johnson received a partial refund, but still cannot access her stem cells.

"Even if they get approved and reopen tomorrow, I never want to hear about Celltex again," she said. "You’ve got all these people that are waiting for stem cells, that they now can’t receive because the FDA is basically holding our cells hostage. We can’t have our cells back, because the FDA has declared them a biological drug."

Johnson’s unintentional relationship with the FDA has put her "on the front lines from the beginning."

"The FDA seems to be following me around and shutting off my resources," she said. "But living is more important to me than fighting the FDA.

"I have a lot of brain damage. If I held my brain in my hands and put out cigarettes on my brain, those \(holes\) are what lesions are. I have almost 70 lesions now — real scars on my brain.

"So I’ve got to plan, ‘When can I get stem cells the next time? How long will it take me to raise that money? Where will I go to have it done? How will I get there?’"

This urgency took Johnson to Frankfurt, Germany in November 2012 — one month after the Celltex procedure fell through.

"The clinic in Frankfurt was taking stem cells from your bone marrow and putting them directly into your spinal cord — directly into your central nervous system," Johnson said. "I was in a lot of pain and ready to put a gun to my head. I was ready to risk anything."

Johnson received 600 million of her own stem cells through a spinal cord injection, as well as an IV.

Three weeks after the procedure, Johnson could walk unassisted. 

"This is all still unreal," she says in a YouTube video. "I’m waiting for the sky to fall. I’m waiting for the disease to ruin my life again."

As hopeful and healthy as she may currently feel, Johnson said she is not naive. MS symptoms never go away, and there is no cure. 

"I don’t think stem cells are fixing any of \(the lesions\)," she said. "I think what they’re doing is decreasing the inflammation in my body and giving me a big jolt of, ‘Hello, life. I can move.’ The disease is still continuing its process and, eventually, it will come back.

"It’s a race against time and the disease, and no one knows what the disease is going to do. But I’m not willing to wait around and die while all these doctors try to figure it out."

Johnson has spent the past 12 years documenting the progression of her disease, as well as all of her stem cell treatments, through her YouTube channel and her art.

She feels it is her responsibility to show the world what MS looks like — and how serious of an illness it really is.

"Because it’s invisible, people think MS is manageable," she said. "So we’ve got people with MS that are scared to tell people how bad it is, because you can’t see it. We’re already used to the whole world telling us we’re crazy for saying what we’re saying. So we don’t say anything to anyone just so we can pretend we’re fine enough to get by — just to get by.

"I want to give those people the freedom to be taken seriously, first of all. But my focus is mainly to let people know what people with illnesses have to deal with, especially with something like this where no one has a clue. It’s not treated like cancer or AIDS or cerebral palsy — something obvious that you can see. These obvious diseases are killer. But so is MS."

Through Johnson’s documentary footage, which she hopes will become a film some day, she has become a beacon of hope for others.

"I’m improving every day and never giving up," she says in a YouTube video. "Multiple sclerosis will not win this fight."
