__DA’s plan: Hamstring gangs__

Injunction would make gang activity illegal for members

Published on June 21, 2014 in The Port Arthur News

Port Arthur may appear like an average American town during the day\.

Run\-of\-the\-mill buildings, pocked pavement, a shopping mall with chain outlet stores, mom\-and\-pop restaurants, and an industrial skyline make PA similar to many other Southeast Texas communities\.

However, drive by a carwash or run\-down gas station, linger a little too long in any of the four cardinal directions, and visitors will notice something amiss\.

A fully occupied car that doesn’t leave the lot for hours\. Men who stand around talking on a street curb or walk the streets in excessively large numbers\. Graffiti — territorial markings — that warns outsiders to stay away and residents to keep their mouths shut\.

As much as we don’t want to acknowledge it, Port Arthur has a gang problem — one that Jefferson County District Attorney Cory Crenshaw and the Port Arthur Police Department seek to remedy\.

“People don’t feel safe in their neighborhoods\. Parents are scared to let their kids go outside to play,” Marcelo Molfino, PAPD Street Crimes Unit investigator, said\.

This city\-wide fear is precisely what Crenshaw aims to dissipate with his plan to file a civil injunction against one of Port Arthur’s prominent gangs — a plan which he presented to the Port Arthur Neighborhood Action Council on Thursday, in the Rob A\. “Bob” Bowers Civic Center\. If his request is successful, it will be the first lawsuit of its kind in Jefferson County\.

“In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan said, ‘Be tough on crime\.’ Now, we want to be smart on crime\. We want to reduce crime before it even starts,” Crenshaw said in a phone interview on Friday\.

An injunction is a court order to do or to refrain from a certain action, or actions\. An injunction against an organized entity, like a gang, would involve a litany of orders to stop engaging in the gang lifestyle\.

“These gang members are basically sued,” Molfino said\. “They’re told within the suit, ‘These are the laws, this is what you’re violating, these are the conditions of the suit\. You cannot be in this area, you cannot fly your colors, you cannot do anything\. If you’re caught violating, it’s a Class A misdemeanor\. You can serve up to a year in jail and pay a $2,000 to 4,000 fine\.’ If they continue to violate, we can ask their fine to be increased\.”

The primary role of a gang injunction, Molfino said, is that it specifies a geographic region in which known gang members — all of whom will receive individual notices of the injunction — are not allowed to congregate\. These regions are called “Safety Zones” or “Target Zones\.”

“Our Target Zone is based on the community history of gang crime, gang involvement, calls for service, things of that nature,” Molfino said\. “Once that area is mapped out, we put that in our injunction\. We can’t say, ‘The whole city of Port Arthur\.’ This first one will be the area where the gangs consider their turf, their area\. This will be the first of many\. We will move on to different gangs in different areas once we see how successful this is\.”

The benefit of a Target Zone, Molfino said, is that police don’t have to wait for a crime to occur to take action\.

“If they’re not allowed to be together in the Target Zone, they’ll be arrested and go to jail,” he said\. “If they’re violating any part of the injunction, they go to jail\. It almost sounds too easy, but the whole point is to get these guys to get out the gang, stop banging — or leave\.

“Why should we have to wait until somebody gets shot? Why should we have to wait to clean up $5,000 in graffiti? This will deter the bigger stuff from happening\. All residents have to do is call, and our guys go after them\. They can be detained and arrested\. Whereas before, if our officers see them at a carwash or whatever, we have to wait for something to happen\.”

Crenshaw will not go into specifics about which Port Arthur gang he and PAPD will target first, he said, because the investigation is ongoing\.

“I don’t want to spoil the surprise or hinder the investigators before their investigation is completed,” he said\. “Thursday night was the beginning of me trying to educate the public\. I gave them an example of a similar injunction that I gave in Bryan in 2009\.

“Based on my experience in Bryan, at the beginning of the injunction, people were hesitant because they didn’t understand it\. Once they became familiar with it and saw the benefits, they became more comfortable with it\. For the community and for law enforcement, the benefits are enormous\.

“Police don’t have to spend all this time going out in the community on gang\-related problems\. People can sit on their front porch and let their kids play in the Safety Zone — where the neighborhood had not been safe to go outside before\. Once the community saw the benefits, they started to understand how it helped the town and wanted to help us\.”

Molfino said the injunction will help the community get involved with cleaning up their town\.

“Our stance is that we can make a community better, but it takes everyone involved,” he said\. “That means people in these communities who are affected by these gang members now have a new way to get involved\.

“A surgeon is not just a man with one scalpel\. He’s going to have lots of tools on his operating table\. Police work is just the same\. We have to utilize every tool we have avail\- able to us, and this is just one more tool for us to work with\.

“In our line of work, we have to be proactive\. We’re not playing to tie\. We’re playing to win\.”
