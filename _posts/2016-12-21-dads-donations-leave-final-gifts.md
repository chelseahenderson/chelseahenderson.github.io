From a young age, children are curious about where they come from and how they get here\. Toddlers hear about a stork who delivers babies to the doorstep, teenagers are told about the “birds and the bees,” and high school biology teachers educate their students about human reproduction\.

But some parents are faced with more difficult conversations\. Reproductive technology has enabled parents to store sperm and embryos that will be implanted in the mother, or even a surrogate — sometimes even after one parent has died\.

Posthumous conception — conception after the death of a parent — by artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization has created new legal issues for the conceived children\. When a woman is inseminated with the dead father’s sperm, laws that establish that a sperm donor is not the child’s legal father have had the effect of excluding the deceased father from fatherhood — potentially affecting the child’s citizenship, legal rights, inheritance and order of succession\.

Karen Capato, a mother of eight\-year\-old twins conceived after her husband’s death, went before the U\.S\. Supreme Court March 19 to fight for her children’s right to their Social Security survivors benefits\.

“This is not about the money, which is true for most of these women,” Capato said in an email interview\. “It is about cancer patients’ rights and social security benefits in today’s world, where the law clearly hasn’t caught up with the times\.

“It was surreal to watch and listen while the court was focused on various definitions of ‘child’ and ‘dependency\.’ It was strange to be in the room and listen to people talk about whether your children are ‘children\.’ I thought there would be more of a human interest slant to the case, but it was strictly about interpretation of the Social Security Act written in 1939\.”

Capato said that she and her husband Nick were trying to have a second child as soon as they had their first, and knew that “time was ticking\.” Nick was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 1999\.

“My husband’s diagnosis was severe, and his death was pending,” she said\. “We both wanted our son to have at least one sibling — especially if he didn’t have a father figure in his life\.

“We had begun the cycle months before he died\. At that time, we thought he had six to 12 months to live\. We even had infertility appointments that week he landed in the hospital\. My husband told me to keep the appointment \(because\) he wanted this for us\. We agreed that I would still go to the appointments and then meet him in the hospital for a full account of our next steps\. He died that same week\.

“Immediately after Nick died, I continued the process that we had started\. It took nine months\. I was under major stress\. I had just lost my husband and lived far away from any friends or family\. I also worked full time, needed to sell our house and buy a new one near family in New Jersey — not to mention being the sole caretaker of our six\-month\-old infant\.”

Capato gave birth to twins 18 months after her husband’s death\. She applied for Social Security survivors benefits, but her claim was rejected\.

“I was told that we were denied because there was no evidence that these were my husband’s kids,” Capato said\. “This was a very simple thing to prove, but ending up taking years in courts\.”

In Capato’s hearing, Justice Antonin Scalia said that federal policy, “disfavors children who are born after the father has died, which is in accord with the title of the statute: Survivors Benefits\. What is at issue here is not whether children that have been born through artificial insemination get benefits\. It’s whether children who are born after the father’s death get benefits\.”

Joannah Labrador, of Orange County, Calif\., has a pending survivors benefits case with the Social Security Administration for her 10\-month\-old daughter Michaela Grace\.

“The Social Security Administration has been inconsistent in granting benefits in cases like mine,” Labrador said in an email interview\. “It’s not fair for some posthumously\-conceived children to receive survivors benefits and others not\. I hope the court will clarify how the SSA is supposed to handle these matters so that there will be no more ambiguity\.”

Michaela is named for her father Michael, who was a professional musician\. He played guitar for entertainer Paul Anka for around 15 years\. Michael was diagnosed with kidney cancer in May 2009, and he died 10 months later\.

“We married later in life — a month before my 40th birthday and his 52nd,” Labrador said\. “We had tried to get pregnant for a few months on our own, but we were not successful\. I decided that we should work with a fertility clinic because of our ages\. Two months before Michael was diagnosed with cancer, we completed our first IVF\. I didn’t get pregnant, but we had frozen embryos and frozen sperm from that cycle\. We put our plans on hold to focus on Michael’s cancer treatment with the intention of continuing on once his health was stable\.”

The Labradors never got the chance to continue together because Michael’s cancer was so aggressive\. Even if they’d proceeded with fertility treatments in summer of 2009, Michael wouldn’t have lived long enough to know his child, Labrador said\. Three months after his death, Labrador had a frozen embryo transfer \(FET\), but she did not get pregnant\.

“I felt strongly that I had a moral obligation to the frozen embryos,” she said\. “I believe that life begins at conception\. They had been ‘in storage’ for a year at the time my husband passed\. I did not think that I would be emotionally and physically up for another IVF without my husband’s presence, but once I got the negative results from the FET, I was determined to try one more time\. I just felt like all my hopes and dreams for marriage and family were crashing down around me\. I’m so glad I did the second IVF\. Six months after my husband’s passing, I was pregnant with Michaela\.”

Labrador said that she did not have her daughter to receive the benefits\. She was unaware of survivors benefits for posthumously\-conceived children until she learned of another woman who was able to get benefits for her daughter\.

“I applied for benefits with that knowledge, and had no idea that there was anything controversial about doing so,” she said\. “In my mind, Michaela is unquestionably her father’s daughter, and I don’t see why she shouldn’t receive survivors benefits — especially since others have previously done so\. My husband contributed to Social Security for about 35 years\. It seems only fair that his flesh and blood would receive those benefits now\.

“Michaela is too young to be aware of the circumstances of her conception or the controversy regarding Social Security benefits\. My naivete regarding the benefits led to me hiring a nanny for two days a week with the intention of relieving my parents and my mother\-in\-law of two days of babysitting while I work\. That will not be something that I will be able to afford to do next school year \(I’m a teacher\), so they will spend more days caring for Michaela\. Should the court render a decision that results in us receiving benefits in a timely manner, then I will be able to reconsider her childcare arrangements\. If we are to receive benefits in the future, they will go towards her educational expenses\.”

Attorney Nancy Hart, of Beaumont, describes herself as the “clearinghouse for moms of posthumously\-conceived children,” because officials consider her the first mother to conceive a child after her husband died\.

Hart’s husband, Edward William Hart Jr\., was an aerospace engineer at the Stennis Space Center in Picayune, Miss\. The couple was living in Slidell, La\. when Edward was diagnosed with esophageal cancer on March 19, 1990\.

“We went to M\.D\. Anderson Hospital in Houston for treatment,” Hart said\. “He went through two rounds of chemotherapy and then had surgery\. A little over a week after his surgery, he got up to walk for the first time\. He threw a blood clot and died two days later\. I was in the hospital room with him when he had the blood clot\. They called ‘Code Blue’ and I felt so helpless because he just looked at me with terror in his eyes\. He wanted me to help him\.”

Hart said that the doctors at M\.D\. Anderson told her husband that he would be sterile after chemotherapy\. They recommended that Edward store sperm at a bank so that the couple could have children in the future\.

“We went back to Slidell for a week,” Hart said\. “On the day we were supposed to leave to go back to Houston, my husband decided to go to the Fertility Institute in New Orleans to leave sperm\. I was so aggravated with him because it was time for us to leave for Houston\. He was insistent about driving into New Orleans to do this\. On our last drive over from Slidell to Houston, Edward started talking about his will\. He said he had forgotten to mention some of his property\. He then told me to always remember that I could have a child\.

“I visited the Fertility Institute of New Orleans three weeks after his death\. I went through fertility treatments and on Sept\. 7, 1990, I went to the hospital for the procedure\. I only got one attempt because there was just enough sperm for one try\. My husband’s sperm count was very low because he had been so sick\. The doctors told me that I would not get pregnant, but I decided to go ahead and give it a try\. They implanted eight eggs and then I had a positive pregnancy test\. The doctors were really nervous because they were afraid I would be pregnant with too many babies, but after an ultrasound, I found out that I was carrying only one\.”

Hart gave birth to Judith Christine Hart, now Judith Christine Hart Hoffman, a Lamar University sophomore, in Slidell on June 4, 1991\. Hart sued the Social Security Commissioner in 1994 because they denied her daughter Social Security survivors benefits\.

“They said my daughter was not my husband’s legal child,” Hart said\. “In Louisiana, a child born more than 300 days after the death of a man is presumed not to be the child of the deceased man\. Judith’s due date was one year to the day of my husband’s death\.”

Hart and her daughter went to the U\.S\. Federal District Court in New Orleans, La\. in February 1996\. Judith was 4\-years\-old\.

“I was terrified while I was in court,” Hart said\. “The court room was big and impressive\. I felt like I was not worthy enough to be in such a place\. But then I realized that I had a right to be in this courtroom, as did every American\. I actually felt a lot of pride about our judicial system\.

“About a week after the hearing, the SSA called my attorney and wanted to settle the case\. They agreed to give Judith the benefits and look at their regulations in light of the new reproductive technology, if I would drop my lawsuit\. We all agreed\.”

Capato said that the option of conceiving posthumously is a comfort to families like hers, particularly for cancer patients like her husband\.

“It was devastating for him to think that his life was ending, but it was also painful for him to think that his new wife and soul mate was about to lose her dreams and wishes, too,” she said\. “We wanted to have a family\. He was a generous, selfless man, and he really wanted to know that he would be able to fulfill his wife’s dreams and give his son a brother or sister that he could grow up with\.

“Yet, he didn’t want me to feel burdened financially\. He would have been comforted and relieved to have known or thought that his wife and child were being taken care of and supported\. It may give all terminal cancer patients that are in the child\-bearing stages some sense of comfort that they have given their wife and family an amazing gift — even in the face of death\.”

Labrador said that parents considering posthumous reproduction should consider the pros and cons of their decision\.

“Being an only parent is not easy,” she said\. “Really think long and hard about doing it on your own\. I am blessed to have an incredibly supportive family — including my in\-laws\. Also, one should be prepared that some people will never be able to understand why you would do such a thing, and they will not applaud your decision\.

“I wanted to finish what Michael and I had started together\. Having my daughter has given me a renewed sense of purpose in my life\. She has brought so much joy not only to me, but to Michael’s family and my family\. We all miss Michael so much\. He was the kind of person who lit up a room when he walked in\. Everybody loved him\.

“Having Michaela is like having a little bit of him this side of Heaven\.”
