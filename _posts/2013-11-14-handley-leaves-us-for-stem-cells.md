When most 30-somethings travel to a different country for a week, they’re looking for culture, entertainment, inspiration, or simply to have a good time. If they’re headed to Germany for a few days, they’re usually looking for beer — or lederhosen. To each his own.

But there’s a small niche of the tourism industry that caters to the medical needs of U.S. citizens. These hospitals and clinics open their doors to anyone with a passport and fulfill a distinct need that Americans can’t satisfy in the States.

They provide the avenues to medical treatment that patients can’t access in the "Land of the Free," due to increasingly restrictive regulations implemented by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Nederland-native Richard Handley traveled to Germany in September. But unlike most 31-year-olds, Handley didn’t taste of sip of beer during his four-day stay. He even had a 12-hour layover in Amsterdam on the flight back home — and he never left the airport.

He went to Germany with one thing on his mind — to receive autologous stem cell injections to treat his cerebral palsy — and no amount of booze or recreational drugs was going to deter that.

__‘Nothing better than showing results’__

Lounging on his living room couch, Handley is all smiles.

He listens for the front door, anticipating his nephew’s arrival. When the toddler runs in, Handley scoops him up for some roughhousing and — one day, not too far in the future, a few piggyback rides.

It’s a beautiful October day and he’s never felt better.

In the beginning stages of training for marathons — maybe even triathlons, because, "Why not?" — the Lamar alumnus is looking for sponsors. His goal is to enter as many races and physical competitions as he can in order to raise awareness for stem cell therapy.

Two years ago, Handley couldn’t have fathomed waking up before the sun every morning just to lace up his running shoes.

Thanks to Dr. Stefan Zapf at the Institut für Bildgebende Diagnostik in Frankfurt, Germany, Handley is living a completely different life today than he was a short two months ago.

In a procedure that took less than an hour, Zapf extracted bone marrow from Handley’s tailbone, put it into a centrifuge to isolate his stem cells, and injected those stem cells into his spinal cord.

Handley, who was diagnosed as a toddler with moderate cerebral palsy diplegia, has spent his entire life searching for medical treatment that will "catch up to his ambition" and allow him to walk unaided.

Stepping up to the treadmill in his Nederland home, it looks like Handley has found the treatment he’s been waiting for.

"It’s the best thing I’ve ever done — for sure," he said. "It’s been completely worth it. I just want it to be available to as many people as possible. I think, really, that’s what the idea of being a sponsored athlete is about. It’s more about advocacy than anything.

"Now that I can work — there are easier ways to make a dollar than doing all the work I would have to do to do a triathlon or to run a marathon. But as far as getting the word out there and advocating for this amazing procedure, really, there’s nothing better than showing the results."

__‘Get the first stroke out of the way early’__

Handley’s results are the capstone of his lifetime of victories toward overcoming cerebral palsy, caused by a stroke in the womb.

"It’s good to get the first stroke out of the way early," he said in August, exactly one month before his stem cell treatment in Frankfurt. "I like to think that having the first stroke that early — that’s my one per lifetime, so I’m good."

Handley jokes, but that early stroke led to 30-plus years of physical therapy and surgeries to treat his neurological disease.

His mother, Melinda, said she knew something wasn’t right with Richard’s feet when he was three months old. She took him to hospitals and clinics across the state for physical therapy, but he wasn’t formally diagnosed with cerebral palsy until he was two years old.

"They never come out and say, ‘It’s this’ or ‘It’s that,’" she said. "One day during clinic, I literally had to ask, ‘So what is his diagnosis?’ And that’s when the doctor said — cerebral palsy. And that’s kind of what I thought anyway, but I kept thinking, ‘I need to hear it. Someone just say something.’ They would never answer questions like, ‘Will he walk? Will he talk? Will he be able to…?’

"They’re not going to give you hope. They will never give you hope. Because when you have a child you has CP, you never know — and they don’t, either — to what degree the physical disability, mentally or anything, because they just don’t know which part of the brain or how much damage. It can be mild, moderate or severe. He’s moderate because he is diplegic, which means one side doesn’t work with the other — his body works against one another on each side."

That’s when Handley started going to the CP Foundation — now known as the Shorkey Center — once a month for physical and speech therapy. On top of their monthly visit, Melinda drove her son to Shriners Hospital for Children in Houston every few months for additional therapy.

Handley did not start to walk until after he was two years old — with the aid of a walker. After two more years, he graduated to using crutches and wearing metal braces on his legs.

Handley said he doesn’t remember much of his early childhood, but he remembers his first major surgeries to "straighten" his legs.

In May 1988, he was six years old. He received 10 muscle releases — five on each leg — at Shriners. The doctors cut into his legs and "snipped" his muscles to "loosen" them.

"Then in the summer of ’99, I had what Shriners delightfully calls, ‘The Double Whammy,’ where they redo all of the muscle releases from ’88 and just for giggles, they break both my femurs to ‘straighten’ my knees," Handley said, sarcastically. "My left leg has always been my weaker leg, but before, my knees would pull in \(when I stood up\).

"I had both of my legs cast for months and months and months, and essentially, they cast my feet wrong. Every time I would have a muscle spasm, the top of my foot would rub up against my cast. They cut the casts off early, because I was just in constant pain — the casts were ripping holes in my feet."

The original casts and the resulting holes put Handley in a wheelchair for two years — maybe more, he said.

"While I think the surgery was certainly the best option at the time, it turned my life upside down," he said. "I have so many questions for Shriners, that’s not even at the top of my list."

__‘I’m going to fundamentally reprogram my brain’__

The question at the top of his list, he said, is why Shriners’ doctors never mentioned hyperbaric chambers — which flood the body with highly-concentrated amounts of oxygen in order to speed recovery.

"I went to Shriners from the age of six months to 19 years, and they never once mentioned the word ‘hyperbaric’ to me," Handley said. "Hyperbaric chambers have been used to treat CP since 1984. Draw your own conclusions — I have.

"I honestly believe, had I been put in a chamber in let’s say ’84, ’85-ish — I’m three years old. I might walk with a limp today. I might not. Because the earlier you can expose the brain to hyperbaric oxygen, the easier it is to heal everything. Most of my damage was 25, 24 years old before I ever got any hyperbaric \(treatment\) at all — so a lot of that damage is just dead."

Handley has owned a portable hyperbaric chamber for the past three years. The chamber delivers 95 percent pure oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres, he said, which is roughly 11 feet below sea level.

"At that atmospheric pressure, your blood capillaries open, and it allows the oxygen to flow more freely and reach places it couldn’t otherwise reach," Handley said. "I’m using it, primarily, to reach damaged parts of my brain. If there is a need there, the oxygen is going to repair, restore and revitalize it."

Handley saw results just one week after he began hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

"I have always had joint pain in my hips, knees and back," he said. "Within a week, I was 90 percent pain free. Within three weeks, I went from using two crutches to one."

Handley said his way of approaching cerebral palsy has completely changed since he first introduced his brain to hyperbaric oxygen.

"You’re almost indirectly brainwashed into thinking that cerebral palsy is a physical problem," he said, "after the years of physical therapy and leg lifts, and, ‘Oh, we’ll cut your hamstrings and break your legs.’

"Cerebral palsy is a neurological problem with physical symptoms, and neurological problems have neurological solutions — and that’s, essentially, what the chamber is. Just the progress I’ve made since I started approaching it that way has been absolutely remarkable.

"You’ll drive yourself crazy trying to treat this as a physical problem. I will never be strong enough to completely overpower my brain — not as it’s currently constituted."

And that’s where the stem cells come in.

"It’s amazing," Handley said. "I can say I am going to fundamentally reprogram my brain — and mean it — with a straight face. That’s the only way to describe this treatment — \(hundreds of\) millions of stem cells injected through the spinal cord. Once they break the blood-brain barrier and go to work replacing dead and damaged cells, that’s the only way to put it. You’re fundamentally reprogramming your brain."

__‘Prostituting my pain’__

Handley said he started "seriously thinking" about stem cells in August 2012. Nine months later, he launched a fundraiser online with an initial goal of $20,000. By Aug. 12, 2013, he had raised more than $16,000.

He said as much as he wishes health insurance companies would cover treatments like hyperbaric oxygen therapy and stem cell therapy, he knows that each time he has to raise funds for medical expenses he also raises awareness for less-traditional medical practices.

"You know, raising money for yourself is such a weird thing," he said. "I always joke about ‘prostituting my pain,’ because on some level, that’s what it is. But, really, spreading the word has always been important to me.

"My recovery is more or less meaningless unless I share it. Because, essentially, what do I have? I have a balance problem. If I took care of this balance problem, it would be great for me, but in the great scheme of things — ‘dude with a balance problem no longer has a balance problem’ — not that big of a deal. But if I take it and share it, then, hopefully, other people can get something from it. That’s where the value is."

Handley said it’s not that stem cells are the "last" option, but they are the "latest" option.

"You never know what the future holds, but they’re the best available option," he said. "It really always has been, because as good as repairing damaged brain cells is, replacing them is better.

"And it’s not like this clinic in Germany is the only place in the world that does it, either. It’s done all over the world — just not here."

Before Handley packed his bag and traveled overseas, his mother expressed her concerns.

"He’s had quite a bit of surgery already — releases so his muscles aren’t so tight and straightening his feet out more, eye surgeries at six months old and 11 months old, because he was cross eyed from the cerebral palsy — and here we are, 31 years later, now going to do this," Melinda said, sighing.

"How comfortable are you?" Handley asked his mother.

"I’m really comfortable," she said.

"OK, good," he said, relieved.

"I’m more comfortable than I thought I would be," Melinda continued. "Because at the beginning of him talking about this, I was just like, ‘Here we go, oh no\!’ But I do know more about it —"

"What if I told you that the needle is enormous?" Handley quipped, laughing.

"I already told you that — don’t\!"

"No, my brother had the best line in the history of America\!" Handley continued. "Jesus, he might have said the funniest thing I’ve ever heard."

"Which, I guess depends on what your humor is," Melinda interrupted, laughing.

"We were talking about an email from the German doctor where he said, ‘Yeah, I’ve seen people with crutches no longer need them,’" Handley cued his mother. "\(My brother\) goes, ‘Yeah, they no longer need crutches — because they’re in wheelchairs.’ I laughed for 20 minutes — just like, ‘You son of a bitch. Now I need confirmation.’ Oh, yeah, they don’t need crutches — they’re basically heads in jars at this point."

"Welcome to the Handley household," Melinda added. "You’ve got to have humor. We laugh about it. It’s not a funny thing, but —"

"What’s not funny about paraplegia?"

"Richard\!" his mother scolded. "And you know, I didn’t even think — it never entered my mind. My worst-case scenario was that it does not work as well for him as he had hoped it would. That’s when he comes out with —"

"No, you might be feeding me for the rest of my life\!" he finished.

"But in all seriousness — seriousness," Melinda said, calming herself down. "We do take it very seriously when we need to."

Handley said he has two sets of expectations for his results following treatment.

"On the low end, these stem cells will take care of my pain and fatigue issues to the point that I can hold down a 40-hour-a-week job and live a fairly normal life," he said. "And honestly, it’s hard for me to imagine a scenario where that doesn’t happen. That, to me, is the absolute floor of this. Now, on the high end of things, I drop my crutch and get on with life, and that’s entirely possible.

"My feeling is if I’m given a remarkable recovery, it’s my responsibility to do something remarkable with it. And the fact that I can sit here and think, ‘If this works the way I think it’ll work, triathlons are not off the table. Marathons are not off the table’ — that’s amazing. I just want to get the absolute most of out my body no matter where it lands."

__‘Next year I’m getting her a salad shooter’__

Handley was injected with just under 400 million of his own stem cells on Sept. 12 — his mother’s birthday.

"Next year, I’m getting her a salad shooter — something that doesn’t require a 16-hour plane flight," he said, laughing.

Seriously, though, Handley said he’s already met his low-end expectations.

"I could go to work tomorrow — I could work today," he said six weeks after treatment. "My energy level is through the roof. I’m in zero pain, which has allowed me to work out like I’ve never worked out before. I’m getting stronger because of that. I’m recovering faster. My overall ease of movement is better. Really, just everything is better.

"If I have pain now, I can trace it to something — which is amazing. Before, it was like, ‘Oh, my back hurts. Because it’s Thursday.’ To really narrow it down to just a few things — literally, everything I do is easier."

Handley said the doctor told him to expect "a slow, gradual climb over the next year" because his stem cells will continue to search for cells in need of repair.

"I’m seeing changes and progress all the time," he said. "But if all the changes and all the progress stopped today, I would still be completely happy with it.

"If I didn’t know anything about stem cells or the results that other people have had, or anything like that, and someone came to me in May, when I first started raising money, and said, ‘OK, if you can raise X amount of money in X amount of time, you can go have an operation that will take all of your pain and fatigue issues away — improve everything in your life’ — I would take it 10 times out of 10 with no expectation of potentially getting off the crutch.

"If that was never even presented to me, I would take just this as a finished product every day of the week. I couldn’t be happier with what’s it’s done.

"Really my only complaint over the past six weeks is like, ‘Four days of bad German food.’ That’s not bad at all," he added, laughing.

__‘People are dying needlessly’__

After hearing Handley testify that undergoing stem cell therapy is "like that scene in Pulp Fiction when they open the brief case" — the culmination of "everything I’ve worked for" — it’s hard to imagine a reality in which patients are denied that same satisfaction and "sense of euphoria."

But because of the Food and Drug Administration’s limiting regulations, more and more Americans are leaving the country in search of treatments they feel entitled to — especially when the only "drugs" they’re searching for are their own stem cells.

Handley paused while contemplating the FDA’s "right" to regulate autologous stem cell therapy.

"I’m trying to be both polite and slightly profound, while not being profane," he mused.

"I just think it’s terribly sad," he began. "For me, it’s just a severe inconvenience. Because \(treatment’s\) not covered by the FDA, insurance won’t cover it. So not only do I have to travel, but I also have to raise the money and do all that — which for someone with my ability level and education, it’s inconvenient but doable. I have so many advantages that other people don’t have.

"But what was an inconvenience for me is costing other people their lives, and that’s what it boils down to. People are dying, or suffering — needlessly."
