__Matter of \(mis\)perception__

Published on Feb\. 24, 2010 in University Press

*Editor’s note: This is the second installment of a three\-part series on eating disorders\.*

Women are pressured in different ways than men when it comes to their bodies and what it takes to be considered attractive\. For some, curves are a must, and they will practically kill to have them and to represent voluptuous women well\. They aim for the va\-va\-voom effect when they shop for clothes and select their meals and exercise routines\.

However, some women ditch their natural curves to go for a more Kate Moss, just\-rolled\-out\-of\-bed slender and gorgeous look\. A poor body image, episodes of physical or sexual abuse, career paths and media images can combine in dangerous ways when the words “beautiful” and “perfect” become associated with terms like “thin” and “skinny\.”

A 19\-year\-old Lamar University sophomore from Beaumont, whose name has been changed to “Betty” to preserve her anonymity, began starving herself when she was 12 years old\.

“I hated myself so much,” Betty said\. “I was abused as a child, so it took its toll on me\. My mom would beat me, and my brother would strangle or drown me in the bathtub\. I think it was because he hated my mom, because she beat him too\. He just kind of took it out on me\.

“I was also abused by my babysitter\. My parents were divorced from the time I was born until the time I was eight\. My mom divorced my dad, and I think that's what sent her off the deep end\. I think that was why she was so mad and why she beat the hell out of us\.”

Betty's years of abuse manifested themselves in the form of anorexia and cutting\.

“Cutting was mainly just because I was so pissed about my babysitter, being molested, my parents beating the hell out of me and everything else,” she said\. “I had low self\-esteem and a low self\-image; that's mainly why I started starving myself\.”

Having a poor self\-image is a common warning sign that an individual has an eating disorder, according to Eating Disorders Awareness and Prevention, Inc\.

Another trigger for these disorders can be the environment an individual works in\. A 44\-year\-old Lamar employee, whose name has been changed to “Marilyn,” was a professional dancer for 15 years\.

“I remember always thinking that I was 'fat,'” Marilyn said\. “At a very young age, like even at 10\-years\-old, I thought I was fat\. And it's really because my sister was so thin\. The more serious I got about dance, it was always such a big issue \(because\) you had to make weight\. I think when I started getting weighed\-in and my job depended on it — like I would lose my job or be fined if I didn't make weight — that's when the actual act of it started happening\. My profession depended on my appearance; that's when I started with the bulimia\.”

Marilyn describes herself as a bulimic with anorexic tendencies, because she said her actions were both bulimic and anorexic\. However, her body weight never became that of an anorexic\. She restricted her diet to 700 calories per day for 15 years, but her weight wasn't low enough to be considered anorexic due to muscle mass\.

“I guess \(my disorder\) got worse when I started doing Las Vegas reviews,” Marilyn said\. “Our appearance was more important than any other type of show that I worked in\. They didn't do body fat back then\. The more I worked out the heavier I got because I put more muscle on\.

“They wanted me to weigh 118lbs\. That's pretty small, and that was with a lot of muscle mass\. I looked healthy because I had so much muscle mass\. I couldn't satisfy them\. They would look at me and go, 'Well you look great, but your appearance doesn't match the scale\.' At the end of the day, they were more concerned with the numbers on the scale than what I looked like\. So then I would go to drastic measures to make the numbers less\.”

Marilyn purged by self\-induced vomiting, taking “all\-natural laxatives and diuretics,” and working out excessively days before she had to weigh\-in\.

“If you knew the day you're going to weigh\-in, you'd start fasting three days before that, restricting all your food and probably workout two or three hours on a cardio machine every day,” she said\. “You’d go in and out of a steam room every day, in and out; then the day that you weigh in, you would just maybe suck on ice, not even drink a sip of water, and probably do two hours of cardio that day, and go in and out of a sauna off and on for two hours\. Then you'd come out of the sauna every 10 minutes just to see if you'd lost one pound\. Because one pound could be the difference between you having your job\.”

She said that her disease took a very different direction when she started in a company that would do random weigh\-ins\. Since she couldn't prepare the week before, her disease started running her life every day\.

“When I worked for a company and it was random, then it just became like that all the time,” she said\. “If I ate at night a half a bowl of frozen yogurt, and I felt that it was over the amount that I should have had that day, then I had to get rid of it somehow, someway, because I was so scared that I was going to go in and get weighed\-in\. I think that's when the disease took off in a different direction, very dangerous\. Before, I could get by with it because I had control over it\.”

Marilyn hid her disease from everyone for 15 years, she said\. When she decided it was controlling her instead of the other way around, she called her mother and asked if she could move back home to Beaumont\.

“I said, 'I cannot get on a scale\. There's no way; I cannot get on the scale,'” she said\. “My mom was like, 'Marilyn, just calm down\. You'll be fine; you always make your weight\.' I was like, 'No, you don't understand\. I'm falling apart; I'm going to die\. I'm going to absolutely die if I continue with this disease\.' I said, 'Can I please move home? Can I please go back to college and get a Master's degree or something\. I cannot live in this environment anymore; it's going to kill me\.' My mom was just like, 'Well, come home\.’”

It was her “defining moment” just like others who have to “hit rock bottom\.”

She went into work that day and gave two weeks notice\. She said she's never weighed in again for anyone except herself\.

“I moved home and never went back, which is really hard to deal with,” she said\. “You don't want to think that a disease like that defeated you\. I really wasn't ready to give up my dance career, but it was killing me\. I wasn't ready\. I could still be there dancing right now, so there's days I'm resentful that \(the disease\) kicked my butt\. I mean 15 years is a long time, but I think I finally knew it was going to kill me\. I'd end up having a heart attack or something\.”

Betty had a similar defining moment after acting on her anorexia for two and a half years\. Over those years she lost half of her weight, dropping from 180 lbs\. to 90 lbs\. When she was at her lowest weight, she hadn't eaten for a month and said she still didn't like her life or the way she looked\.

“That's why I knew that I needed to start eating or I would literally starve myself to death,” Betty said\. “Even then I could feel my organs in my body start to eat my muscle\. I could feel it; it was really bad\. Whenever you don't eat for a while, it hurts to sleep on your back and your sides because you're just so hungry\. The only way I would be able to sleep would be on my stomach, and even then I had trouble falling asleep\.

“You could see every one of my ribs; you could see my collar bones\. My hip bones stuck out of my skin\. I was very emaciated\. My hair got very thin and very dull looking; I took care of it, but all the vitamins that you eat go to your hair \(so\) it lost its sheen\. I got the calcium deficiency things, the little white things under your nails\.”

As of Betty's interview, the last time she had cut or starved was when she was six months pregnant\. She went three days without eating\. Her baby girl, now 13 months old, was born with a cleft pallet problem in the back of her throat and had surgery to repair it in August\. Betty said she isn't sure if her baby's problem was because she starved or not\.

Even though she didn't eat for those three days, Betty said that her pregnancy did help change how she views herself\.

“The pregnancy helped me realize that I'm fine at the weight that I'm at,” she said\. “It helped my self\-esteem, like, 'I'm carrying a kid inside me\. How weird is this?'”

Marilyn said that eating disorders are deceiving because they don't ever fully go away\. Even though she has never restricted her food or purged since the day she moved back to Beaumont, she said her mind is still in an eating\-disordered state of thinking\.

“It's kind of like a dry drunk,” Marilyn said\. “A dry drunk is a person who was an alcoholic but doesn't drink anymore\. But they never fixed the torment in their mind, what's going on with them internally, so I kind of consider myself almost like a dry drunk\. I think my mind is still diseased, but I don't physically participate in that anymore\.”

She said that even though she is in her 40s, she is scared to go on a diet\. Her doctor is helping her come up with lists of foods to enjoy vs\. foods to avoid in order for her to lose the weight she needs to in a healthy manner\.

“I know how to eat healthy,” she said\. “I know what to do\. I just have to be careful about not obsessing\. For me, if somebody says, 'You need to lose 10 pounds now,' I can do it the healthy way or the non\-healthy way, so I have to be careful that I don't slip into the non\-healthy way\.”

It's good to share her story, she said, because there are so many young girls out there who think they're all alone\. She said the lack of area therapists who deal with eating disorders is a problem\.

“It wouldn't be a bad idea to have a support group on campus,” Marilyn said\. “I've never been big on that kind of stuff\. I'm not the touchy\-feely support group kind of girl, but there is something comforting just knowing that you're not crazy\.”
