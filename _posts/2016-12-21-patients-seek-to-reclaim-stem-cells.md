The relationship between patient and doctor — the foundation of our healthcare and physical wellbeing — is sacred in the United States\.

With the recitation of the Hippocratic Oath or one of its many variations, physicians and other healthcare practitioners declare they will treat the sick to the best of their abilities and to administer prevention — not cure — whenever possible\.

While the oath is not legally binding, most physicians live by its resolution to “do no harm\.” Patients are to be treated with sympathy and respect\. They are not to be seen as a cancerous growth or a fever chart, but as a sick human being in need of healing\.

Met with fairness on the clinic bed and understanding on the clipboard, patients develop a closeness with their physicians that isn’t found in everyday relationships\. Patients, literally, trust their physicians with their lives, because they know those physicians will uphold the values of the field\.

This unique relationship is the only way our healthcare system can operate — through trust, openness and understanding\. When it comes to healing bodies and saving lives, patients and doctors must analyze and compare treatment options together\. It is up to the doctor to provide the best treatment options possible and up to the patient to choose the best of the best in regard to their own body and conscience\.

The Food and Drug Administration encroached upon this sacred relationship when it created its new category of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue\-based products in 2001\.

The agency has strengthened its footing in the years that followed, forcing itself closer and closer to the doctor’s chair and clipboard in determining — and denying — patients’ treatment options\.

__Patients suspect FDA would rather protect its own interests__

“The FDA regulation of autologous stem\-cell transfers is part of a larger story about the role of the FDA in the regulation of pharmaceutical and medical research,” Richard A\. Epstein, Manhattan Institute for Policy Research visiting scholar, writes in “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem\-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation\.”

“Institutionally, the FDA sees its role as ‘Protecting and Promoting Your Health,’ which makes it all seem rather personal to you,” he writes\. “Yet as a personal matter, most Americans do not set their personal presumptions in that way\. When healthy, they do not think about the issue much; but when injury, illness, or disease strikes, they are far more willing to take what they regard as prudent risks than the FDA is willing to let them take\.

“Most people do not want the FDA to protect their own health in making these life\-or\-death choices\. But it does mean that they are uneasy with its aggressive intervention on medical issues, preferring their own judgment as informed by their own physicians and personal advisers\.”

Stem cell patient SammyJo Wilkinson said adult stem cell treatment should be an option in the U\.S\., “especially for patients who have exhausted all other medical options\.”

“There is one stem cell therapy that has come up with resounding consistent safety in phase \(one and two\) trials — using your own, autologous, stem cells,” she said in an email interview\. “Public records show that over 2,000 people have been safely treated in trials, and this is with lab\-cultured cells to reach a higher dose\.

“\(Using\) autologous stem cells derived from bone marrow has been a standard treatment for leukemia and other cancers for over 40 years\. This therapy is well understood\. The risk of tumor or cancer formation has been investigated and found not to be an issue\. That is one reason why no one is doing human trials with the embryonic cells — they grow so aggressively they could lead to cancer\.”

Wilkinson said the FDA does not have “deep scientific expertise” in the effectiveness of stem cell treatment, so the agency is “just trying to clamp down on it before they even understand it\.”

The agency also has a financial stake in classifying stem cells as biological drugs, she said\.

“Investigation New Drug permits \(require\) a $2 million fee to FDA,” she said\. “Classifying stem cells as drugs creates a revenue stream\. The FDA may also be protecting the interests of pharmaceutical companies that are pursuing allogenic \(donor\) stem cell therapies\. If your own adult stem cells are proven to treat the same conditions as these drugs, that is a competitive threat \(to the pharmaceutical companies\)\.”

__Patients band to form advocacy group__

Wilkinson is a member of Patients For Stem Cells, an advocacy group that formed spontaneously following the Houston Stem Cell Summit in October 2012\.

“Our first goal was to correct the negative slant in press stories that cast all stem cell therapies as ‘snake oil,’” Wilkinson said\. “We have accomplished this by telling our own stories to reporters\.”

Wilkinson said the members of Patients For Stem Cells believe that “the access to therapy blockage is being aided and abetted by the FDA\.”

“Our next focus is to correct this regulatory overreach by educating people that they are losing their rights to use their own cells as therapy, because the FDA has declared them to be drugs — subject to years of clinical drug trials as opposed to the practice of medicine, where a patient can decide with their doctor, under informed consent rules, to utilize their own cells as therapy,” she said\.

Wilkinson said personal experience drives her determination to make autologous stem cell therapy more widely available to patients in America\.

“In May of 2012, I was treated in an Institutional Review Board monitored study sponsored by Celltex Therapeutics, a company that banks and expands adult stem cells, then delivers them to treating physicians,” she said\. “The infusions of my own adipose\-derived mesenchymal stem cells, expanded to a therapeutic dose, were to treat multiple sclerosis, which I’ve had since 1995\. It had become secondary progressive MS — disabling — since 2002\. None of the FDA\-approved drugs had helped my condition\. By 2012, my legs were so stiff I was on the verge of complete paraplegia, and I knew a nursing home was not far off\.

“My stem cell treatment has yielded a sustained recovery in 13 of 28 symptoms, including heat intolerance, fatigue, constipation, urinary incontinence, numbness, spasms and spasticity\. I’m even able to take a few steps, now, and look forward to walking again\. Withholding this safe, effective therapy from patients like me is an inhumane sentence to a slow, miserable death\.

“Having a stem cell stay of execution has motivated me to let the world know a solution is at hand, not just for MS, but for neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, or the treatment of joint pain, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and more\.”

Wilkinson said that everyone should be concerned about the FDA’s regulatory action — not just those who are already sick or injured\.

“You never know when you or a loved one could be faced with this,” she said\. “\(Patients For Stem Cells\) invites anyone interested in salvaging this right to join us\. We’re a volunteer effort of concerned patients, not seeking funds, just your attention on this vital matter\.”

__Regulations threaten doctor\-patient relationship__

“The rate of advance in \(the current biomedical revolution\) is a testimony to the creative forces unleashed by the decentralized control over medical procedures,” Manhattan Institute for Policy Research’s Epstein writes\. “But that progress is now threatened by the federal Food and Drug Administration, which seeks to extend its statutory authority to subject these practices to the same oversight that is given to large drug manufacturers in the design and production of new products for the mass market\.

“One area over which the FDA has asserted its power is private adult stem\-cell treatment, which has developed treatment protocols that were not possible a generation, or even a decade, ago\.”

Epstein writes that the FDA has “taken the aggressive position” in its oversight authority over stem cell procedures that re\-inject harvested stem cells into the same person from whom they were removed — “so long as those cells were grown and cultured” outside the patient’s body\.

“Indeed, one promising use of this technique for heart\-attack patients was scuttled after the FDA stepped in to require extensive clinical trials over a hospital that could not afford the high costs of FDA compliance,” Epstein writes\. “It is unclear how many promising similar avenues have been shut off by physicians who were unwilling to run the FDA gantlet of initial approval and constant oversight to bring their techniques to the market in the United States without risk of regulatory censure\.

“But two physicians utilizing one such approach are now challenging in federal court the FDA’s authority to regulate — and effectively prohibit — the use of adult stem cells to mitigate the effects of one widespread malady: degenerative joint conditions\.”

__FDA targets Colorado clinic’s procedure__

The case of “United States of America v\. Regenerative Sciences, LLC,” revolves around a stem cell procedure that was devised by two Colorado doctors, Christopher Centeno and John Schultz, for treating patients suffering from musculoskeletal damage\.

The case targets the doctors’ original cultured Regenexx procedure, or Regenexx\-C, in which the physicians extracted bone marrow and blood samples from the patient\.

“These samples were sent to a laboratory, where they were centrifuged, to isolate active cells from various contaminants, including surface proteins that could set up immunological side effects,” Epstein writes\. “Thereafter, the laboratory treated the patient’s blood platelets with commonly\-used nutrients, infused them into the marrow sample, and incubated the material in a medical\-grade plastic flask\.

“After the resulting mesenchymal stem cells adhered to the plastic flask for several days, the cells were removed and placed in a new plastic flask, where the cycle was repeated with new platelets drawn from the patient’s blood and a new round of basic nutrients\.”

Regenexx\-C is solely meant for autologous use — “the implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer of human cells or tissue back into the individual from whom the cells or tissue were recovered\.”

The FDA claims that the doctors’ procedure involves the manufacturing of “drugs” for sale in “interstate commerce” that falls within its statutory purview to prevent the spread of “communicable diseases” — and therefore is subject to regulation and pre\-market approval, Epstein writes\.

When the case went to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled against Regenerative Sciences — upholding the FDA’s ability to regulate a patient’s own cells\.

On July 23, 2012, the court entered summary judgment for the FDA, dismissed all counterclaims and granted a permanent injunction on the use of the Regenexx\-C procedure in the U\.S\.

__Regenerative Sciences appeals in federal court__

“United States of America v\. Regenerative Sciences, LLC,” now before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, resumed litigation Oct\. 21\.

Audio of the proceedings was posted on the court’s website the day of the trial\. The following comes from the audio file\.

Andrew Ittleman, founder and partner of Fuerst Ittleman David & Joseph, PL, in Miami, Fla\., addressed Judges Thomas Griffith and Srikanth Srinivasan, and Senior Judge Harry Edwards on behalf of Regenerative Sciences\.

“At issue in this case is the FDA’s authority to regulate an autologous stem cell procedure, which is called the cultured Regenexx procedure,” Ittleman said\. “It’s our position that the cultured Regenexx procedure constitutes the practice of medicine\.”

A judge asked Abby C\. Wright, a Department of Justice attorney representing the FDA in this case, how the “authority to issue regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases” is connected to Regenerative Sciences’ stem cell procedure\.

“Any cell or tissue that comes from the human body, obviously, carries a risk that it will have disease,” Wright responded, “so \(21 CFR\) 1271 tissue practices really focus on controlling the possibilities of the spread of communicable disease\.”

__Judges examine ‘practice of medicine’__

According to the audio file, a judge asked Ittleman, “So is your argument that if you’re under the cloak of ‘the practice of medicine,’ the fact that it may be a drug that’s used — a component of which is interstate commerce — it’s not germane to the analysis?”

“Your Honor, it’s a little bit confusing regarding what, here, is being defined as being the drug,” Ittleman responded\. “In \(the previous court’s\) decision, the procedure is a drug\. That makes no sense\.”

“This product, which is the thing in the syringe, doesn’t qualify as a drug or biologic product?” a judge asked\.

“I’m not even conceding that it’s a product, Your Honor,” Ittleman said\.

“There’s something in the syringe,” the judge said, flatly\.

“There’s something in the syringe,” Ittleman agreed\.

“You would concede that it is a thing?” the judge asked\.

“Your Honor, I would concede that those two definitional statutes are broad enough to ensnare ‘that thing,’ whatever it is,” Ittleman said\. “But that is the end of the inquiry\.

“Our position is that we’re engaged in the practice of medicine, and we’re not regulated by federal law because Congress has not explicitly stated in either the Public Health Service Act or anywhere else that the FDA gets to regulate the practice of medicine\.”

The FDA’s Wright began her argument by looking at the statutory definition of “drug,” which is “an article intended for use in the diagnosis, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease\.”

“I think opposing counsel has, here, conceded that their products that they inject into the patient’s knee is, in fact, an article used in the mitigation,” she said\.

“The district court focused on, I think correctly, the fact that the defendants here have admitted that what they are trying to do is to alter the characteristics of these cells\. So when they remove that fluid from the bone marrow, they pull out about 100 million cells — almost all of those cells die immediately\. What they are trying to do is culture what they claim are mesenchymal stem cells, so they mix that with growth factors, enzymes, other drugs, to create their product\.

“What they’re doing is going from a very heterogeneous population of 100 million cells — all different kinds of cells — they’re changing the characteristics of those cells in the sense that now we have more mesenchymal stem cells, and the stem cells themselves have changed the genes and the proteins they express\.”

Ittleman argued that the cultured Regenexx procedure is not a drug because the minimal manipulation standard that puts it into “biological drug” territory is unlawful\.

“Does multiplication alone mean ‘more than minimal manipulation’?” a judge asked Wright\.

“The FDA has explained that it is a case\-by\-case determination, so it’s not a per se rule that culture itself would constitute more than minimal manipulation,” Wright responded\. “My point, only, is that minimal manipulation captures both the potential for contamination in the sense that you’re adding more products, \(so\) there are more and more opportunities for contamination\.”

__Beaumont native waits for court’s verdict__

Claire Hooper, a 48\-year\-old Beaumont native, has been though “prolonged periods of incapacitation” on and off for the past two decades\.

Her running list of medical history includes osteoarthritis, torn cartilage and a cyst in her left knee, and subluxated kneecaps, which means that her kneecaps pop out of socket when she bends her legs\.

On top of her knee conditions, Hooper has three pinched nerves and multiple degenerative discs along her spine — including L4 and L5, located on the lumbar curve, which have deteriorated to the point that her vertebrae are “virtually rubbing bone on bone\.”

“I’ve got two pages of medical history,” Hooper said in her Beaumont home\. “For over 20 years, doctors have taken one look at my MRIs and just thrown buckets of narcotics and muscle relaxers at me\.

“I’ve always refused to become a pain\-pill junkie\. I’ve refused surgery\. I’ve dealt with it all through physical therapy and being an obstinate ass, basically\.”

Hooper said she knew stem cells “had all this great potential,” but it wasn’t until she was faced with “medieval — what the doctor even described as ‘nuts and bolts’ — back surgery” that she began seriously researching stem cell therapy\.

“I now have the direct phone number, email, everything for the doctor I want to work on my knees, who is the doctor taking on the FDA,” she said\. “Dr\. Chris Centeno and Dr\. Schultz are pioneers in stem cell research and orthopedic surgery, and they were doing this forever with no reports of any serious adverse effects\.

“It’s taking your own cells and putting them back into your own body, so there’s no risk of rejection\. There’s none of the issues that you have with embryonic or donor cells of any type where you’re likely to end up on expensive anti\-rejection drugs for the rest of your life and/or do freaky things like grow bone in your eyeballs and other freak\-show women they like to pull out\.”

Hooper said she could go to Colorado now and get stem cell therapy for her knees because a Regenexx procedure for such a small area does not involve expansion and culture — the procedure would count as less than minimally manipulated\.

However, she will not be able to get the cultured Regenexx procedure for her back, which would require multiplying her own stem cells, in the U\.S\. until the federal appeals court makes its decision — if it decides in favor of Regenerative Sciences\. If the court rules in favor of the FDA, Hooper said, she will have to go to Centeno’s clinic in the Cayman Islands for the Regenexx\-C procedure\.

“If I have to go to the Cayman Islands, then I’ll go to the Cayman Islands,” she said\. “But I’d rather fight this fight and be treated on American soil\.”
