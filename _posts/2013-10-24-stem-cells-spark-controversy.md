We live in an age where Miley Cyrus’ provocative dancing and spastic tongue exercises can make national headlines, and more 20-somethings can rattle off Grumpy Cat’s biography than name one of the Nobel Prize winners, so it’s hard to imagine a time in which a scientific discovery went "viral."

Scientists generally don’t receive a lot of hype outside of the world of academia. Most college students know that Pluto is no longer a planet and that something called "dark matter" was proved to exist a few years ago — but unless there’s a "Big Bang Theory" episode about it, it may take some time for millennials to catch wind of new research.

This was also the case in the early 1990s — minus "The Big Bang Theory." The earth was rotating on its axis, orbiting around the sun, doing its own thing. Scientists hadn’t done anything to mess that up, so the rest of the world left them alone to tinker and conduct research. No one knew that the budding — and rapidly expanding — field of stem cell research had been developing for 50 years.

Then news broke of a cloned sheep named Dolly, in 1997, and a global hysteria erupted that had never been documented or matched before — or since.

__Stem cells hit the radar__

Dolly, the first mammal successfully cloned from an adult cell, provoked world-wide speculation about when scientists would begin mass producing humans like an assembly line of mannequins for department stores.

The ewe was created through a two-part cloning process, using somatic cell nuclear transfer \(SCNT\).

"The technique involves taking the nucleus — which contains the genetic material — from a body cell, such as a skin cell, and then transferring the nucleus into an unfertilized egg that has had its genetic material removed," Stem Cells Australia states on its website. "The egg will then divide in the laboratory, and after five to seven days, embryonic stem cells can be isolated from the SCNT embryo. These embryonic stem cells are genetically identical to the cell from which the nucleus was originally removed."

The embryo is then transferred into a surrogate mother to achieve a pregnancy.

With headlines like Time Magazine’s, "Human cloning is closer than you think… Here are the perils," embryonic stem cells — and by extension, all stem cells — got a bad rap before researchers had the chance to explore them properly.

While stem cell research has become increasingly successful in the years since the "Dolly epidemic," doctors, patients and researchers continue to battle the misconceptions left in the aftermath of the cloning war.

__Researchers investigate ‘regenerative medicine’__

"The human body is an efficient machine, and many times self-corrects when it encounters medical problems," John Ritz, graduate program director of STEM education and professional studies at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., writes in "Magic from Human Regenerative Technologies — Stem Cells."

"Scientists have determined that there are several body cells that can reproduce and regenerate," he writes. "Medical scientists and researchers are trying to better understand cell development in hopes of using our own cells to recreate tissues and organs that can be used to grow new organs and tissues if these become damaged.

"This growth from cells is planned to be used for correcting abnormalities as our bodies wear from use, age, disease, and viruses."

Stem cells — the basic cells that make up our bodies — are at the root of such research, Ritz writes.

"They constantly regenerate within our body and can differentiate into other cells, hence being known as stem cells — the stem from which cells grow into body tissue and parts," he says. "They can grow and develop into skin, nerve cells, organs, and much more.

"Consequently, stem cells can form into many different types of cells and structures. This development and growth is known as differentiation. As cells develop, they communicate with each other to determine which cells to develop and how. This determines which cells develop into eyes, skin, bone, etc."

Cell development has three layers: the endoderm, the inner layer, which differentiates to become cells that form into linings of the body cavity, including respiratory tract, digestive tract, and other inner organs; the mesoderm, the middle layer, which differentiates to become the circulatory system, bones, muscles, and connecting tissues; and the ectoderm, the outer layer, which differentiates to become skin, hair, nails, sensory organs, brain and spinal cord.

Ritz writes that stem cell research looks promising to help fix many medical disorders in the near future — five to 20 years away.

However, in lieu of starting another Dolly-scale epidemic, Ritz writes, "the medical community is using the term regenerative medicine and tissue engineering more and more because of the negativism some attach to stem cell research."

__Embryonic, induced cells spark controversy__

There are three types of stem cells — embryonic, adult, and induced pluripotent stem cells.

Embryonic stem cells generally receive the most press because they’re the most controversial — and misunderstood.

Embryonic stem cells can be obtained either from human embryos or by cloning embryos through a somatic cell nuclear transfer — the Dolly procedure.

"Most embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that develop from eggs that have been fertilized in vitro — in an in vitro fertilization clinic — and then donated for research purposes with informed consent of the donors," the National Institutes of Health website states. "They are not derived from eggs fertilized in a woman’s body."

Ritz writes that embryonic stem cells can be programmed genetically by human intervention to become any form of "human body mass," such as skin, bones and organs.

"Embryonic stem cells have greater possibilities of repairing damaged human bodies because of their ability to be turned into any cell types, but their use can cause ethical issues in how they are obtained," he writes. "There is controversy among groups as to the ethics of using these eggs or a fetus, because some believe it is destroying life."

Less controversial are adult stem cells, which are found throughout the body.

"Adult stem cells are mature, and can take on certain human functions such as regenerating muscles or repairing damaged organs," Ritz writes. "They are harvested from our bodies — the healthy cells are isolated using medical technologies and then are injected into damaged areas. It has been shown that they can be used to advance the healing of broken bones or replace skin damaged by burns, and those taken from bone marrow can be used to treat leukemia."

A growing number of physicians offer treatments involving adult stem cells to their patients, which can be performed in their offices, according to Mary Ann Chirba, professor of legal reasoning, research and writing at Boston College, and Alice Noble, senior lecturer in genetic counseling at Brandeis University.

"Autologous adult stem cells, used to treat a variety of conditions, are harvested from the patient, processed, and returned to the same patient," they write in "Our Bodies, Our Cells: FDA Regulation of Autologous Adult Stem Cell Therapies."

Autologous stem cells have the potential to revolutionize a patient’s recovery time following a transplant.

"If one is to have an organ or tissue transplant, e.g., kidney, liver, lung, there must be a match in the blood and genetic make-ups of the donor and recipient," Ritz writes. "To help the recipient’s body to accept this foreign body part, his or her immune system must be desensitized.

"This is done using antirejection drugs called immunosuppressants. The recipient must take these drugs the remainder of his or her life so his or her body does not reject the transplanted organ. Besides the expense involved, the drugs reduce the effectiveness of the body to fight off other infections or viruses. It is very easy for the person on immunosuppressant drugs to catch colds, the flu, or common viruses that most human bodies can readily defend themselves against."

Using autologous — one’s own — stem cells would eradicate a patient’s need for antirejection drugs in the event of a transplant.

A third type of stem cell joined the research foray in 2012 when Sir John B. Gurdon and Dr. Shinya Yamanaka received the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine for their work with "induced pluripotent" stem cells.

Gurdon and Yamanaka "reprogrammed" adult stem cells and "coaxed" them back to an embryonic state — without using eggs or cloning, or destroying embryos.

"It is easy to obtain adult stem cells from human skin. These cells are then reprogrammed using chemicals to suggest to the cells what they can become," Ritz writes "The process is not yet perfect, since the chemicals can only make suggestions to the cell.

"However, using a process such as this avoids ethical questions associated with when cells become human life. Using these techniques, it is hoped that a formula will one day be developed to program adult stem cells to become any cells the researchers might need to treat human disorders. This research should happen in the not-too-distant future."

__Religious, political debates overshadow research__

It has been 16 years since sheep cloning besmirched the name of stem cell researchers, but embryonic stem cells continue to dominate the conversation.

"It should be distinguished that stem cells are available in two varieties — adult and embryonic," Ritz writes. "Adult stem cells can be used for some procedures, but others require the embryonic type, since they can take the form of any cells and can take on different developmental processes.

"Much of the controversy comes from the potential use of embryonic stem cells. Individuals differ in viewpoint as to when human life begins. Some believe that life begins when a human egg is fertilized. Others believe life begins when the child is fully formed and birth occurs."

Embryonic stem cells form between five and six days after the egg becomes fertilized — to get them, you need to use fertilized eggs, he writes.

"Some believe that using fertilized human eggs means destroying life and therefore consider the use of embryonic stem cells unethical," he writes. "This is why some procedures use adult stem cells. However, researchers are beginning to figure out how to create embryonic cells without using fertilized eggs. Others continue to research ways to do this."

With advancements in regenerative medicine, Ritz writes, many ailments are finding techniques for improvement.

"Seeing a person able to walk again after a spinal cord injury, re-growing a finger that has been severed, or re-growing and transplanting an esophagus that has been damaged appear to be miracles," he writes. "These types of medical technologies are improving life.

"Some question whether they are ethical practices. The more we learn of these technologies, the better judgments each can make on an individual basis."
