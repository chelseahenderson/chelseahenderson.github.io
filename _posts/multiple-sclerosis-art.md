__Multiple Sclerosis: Painfully invisible__

Artist documents disease through living journals, drawings

Published on April 25, 2013 in UPbeat

Mismatched striped socks adorn Cecelia Johnson’s feet as she slowly struts across her living room floor, “showing off” her ability to walk\. Her big toe plays peek\-a\-boo from a hole\. She periodically wiggles the sock back down to avoid the cool air in her Houston apartment\.

“You’re going to take a picture of me? I didn’t prepare,” she says, laughing, as she rummages through leaning towers of artwork\. “Is my hair right? Because, you know, I could have a side ponytail\.”

She makes her selections and drops a hefty pile of images on the floor\. Carefully kneeling down, she fans the drawings across a rug, scanning for the pieces that tell her story best\.

“These are my journals,” she says\. “I don’t write journals that much except about medicine, so I draw\.”

The 34\-year\-old was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 12 years ago, when she was a junior art student at Lamar University\. Johnson uses her drawings and paintings to communicate with the world about her life with MS\.

“It’s all about the imagery,” she says\. “Everything that I do is a direct response to what’s happening in my body\. I can actually look at my artwork, without seeing a date on it, and know exactly how I was feeling, exactly what I was doing, exactly where I was, what I was thinking about, what I was dealing with\. I can read that language in my art\. 

“They’re great metaphors, because I feel different at every minute\. One drawing is several days of feelings or maybe just minutes in flashing\. They’re periods of time\. Depending on what kind of day it is and how much I have \(control\) of my hands, sometimes I can just do one layer, and the next day I’ll do another layer\. They evolve\.

“I can’t do it all in one day\. I go back to pieces over months\. I work on at least 40 drawings at once, going back and forth, back and forth\. It’s a process\. It’s not an idea that I’m spending on one drawing\. That is the process — to just keep it moving or it won’t happen\.”

Johnson’s illness prevents her from working, because she never knows what to expect — whether it will be a good day or a bad day\. So she makes art\.

“It’s all I’ve wanted to do since I was born,” she says\. “It’s all I could think about\. And in a way, I’m living my dream\. Isn’t that \(ironic\)?

“I’m bitter about it sometimes\. I’m just like, ‘I don’t want to make art today \(but\) I have nothing else to do\.’ But that’s part of it\. That’s where the tension comes in, and you need tension like that\. Because then I have to force myself to sit down and be like, ‘Fine, I’ll draw something\.’ And then I get into it\.”

Johnson’s work is documentary footage of her life’s battle with a chronic, debilitating, invisible disease\. Her art is all about “letting people in\.”

“This is all very personal,” she says\. “I put it all out there — that’s my nature\. I’ve always been that way\. Because people need a vehicle they can accept and consume nicely, in a package that they can understand and welcome in their life, before they’re going to warm up\.

“It’s like meeting the parents of your boyfriend\. You’ve got to be real nice and sweet, and talk about what they want to hear\. You have to do that first\. But that’s not deception\. It’s giving respect, saying, ‘Look, I’m taking the time to let you know everything about me — but in a way that doesn’t make you uncomfortable\.’ It’s all about presentation\.”

While at Lamar, Johnson worked on intricate pieces — “things that require a steady hand\.” Through the progression of her disease, her fine motor skills have deteriorated\. But, being the “super\-positive” person she is, Johnson has managed to turn her disability into an advantage\.

“I was a painter who worked on wood, mostly, and canvas,” she says\. “I went back to basics of being a cave painter of sorts\. Having done more grand work and having the facility to do that, and then saying, ‘OK, you can’t do that anymore, so you need to do this\.’ I’m learning how to be an artist\. It’s been liberating in a strange way\.

“I don’t feel like there’s got to be these parameters and guidelines\. I definitely feel like we’re the most creative when we have boundaries\. But my boundaries, my limitations, are my disease, and the fact that I can only work on paper\.

“‘The best art is made in times of great turmoil and blah, blah, blah’ — without being cheesy\. But I understand all of that now\. I feel cliché, but it doesn’t really matter because I realized that I have that freedom\. So I’m going to go make art with it\.”

Johnson was reborn as an artist through charcoal pieces\. Then she got colorful and expressive — “no rules\.”

“Everything is different,” she says\. “I don’t see a style of my work\. I’m a figurative artist who can’t really do figurative work\. On the random day where I can do figures, then I go all out — muscles and bones, everything that I can\. I will use my body and physiology of these disease processes\.

“This is kind of the silence of the disease,” she says, sifting through her collection of drawings\. “It’s invisible, and all I can do is just look\. It’s so painful that I can’t cry\.”

Her drawings vary widely, depending on her pain level\.

She makes a selection from the stack — a vibrant, jumble of heavy lines and paint splotches\. A man stares from the page with wide eyes — his lips sewn together\.

“I was in so much pain I couldn’t cry — I couldn’t move, I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t speak\. This was pain,” she says\.

Johnson scans through the drawings and comes across a different kind of pain — a more deliberate, heavy\-lined girl, with large hands, hanging loose at her sides\.

“I was in a lot of pain for this one, too,” she says\. “Because of my hands — the hypoxia\. My blood doesn’t circulate like it should, so I don’t get enough oxygen in my hands\.

“Every time I’m walking or standing, I’m standing like this \(she poses with her arms bent at the sides and her hands hanging loose at the wrists\), because I don’t have the strength\. It’s the easiest way to hold your hands when you don’t have to do anything with your hands\. Even when you have them down, you still have to find things to do\. They can just sit here\.”

She pulls out one painting featuring two figures leaning against each other\. The bodies are neater, with cleaner lines and more balanced colors, than some of the others in the stack\.

“This was another kind of pain — this was a quiet pain,” she says\. “I had more control over my hands\. It was enough for me to just sit and draw, and keep myself focused\.”

Johnson says it’s easy to become “jaded” living with MS — the pain can become unbearable, and staying sane turns into a daily challenge\.

But she soldiers on — there is still more to create\.

“I could never have done this had I not made art a part of my whole story,” she says\. “Drawing is my medicine\.”
