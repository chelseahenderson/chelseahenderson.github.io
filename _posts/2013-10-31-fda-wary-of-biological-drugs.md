The Code of Federal Regulations is by no means "light" reading material. It is a tome of legal knowledge and jargon, the playbook of the United States government. Its pages contain an exhaustive maze of convoluted directions and terminology that, while outlined and defined within the text, hold little meaning for the average reader.

It is down this legal rabbit hole that potential stem cell patients find themselves falling when they seek treatment. And unless they have previous experience in statutory law, they will assuredly find themselves overwhelmed by the red tape that precedes stem cell therapy.

Most Americans know that the Food and Drug Administration reigns over the pharmaceutical industry. But the federal agency also governs the new practice of regenerative medicine, and therein lies the issue for patients and doctors wishing to participate in the practice of stem cell therapy.

__FDA proposes regulating ‘cellular, tissue-based products’__

"Historically, the approach to regulating human cellular and tissue-based products — now called human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products or HCT/Ps — was highly fragmented," the FDA Vaccines, Blood and Biologics Web page states. "In 1997, FDA proposed a new approach to the regulation of HCT/Ps."

This approach would establish 21 CFR Part 1271 — read Code of Federal Regulations, title 21, part 1271 — a "comprehensive regulatory program" for HCT/Ps.

According to the "tiered, risk-based approach that FDA proposed," some cellular and tissue-based products would only be regulated under those new regulations and under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act — which authorizes the FDA "to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases" — while other HCT/Ps would be regulated as medical devices or biological products under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and/or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Between 2001 and 2005, "FDA published three final rules and two interim final rules to implement the proposed approach," the Web page states. FDA adopted as a final rule — without change — the provisions of the last 2005 interim rule on June 19, 2007.

The Code of Federal Regulations defines HCT/Ps as "articles containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient."

Examples include — but are not limited to — "bone, ligament, skin, dura mater, heart valve, cornea, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells derived from peripheral and cord blood, manipulated autologous chondrocytes, epithelial cells on a synthetic matrix, and semen or other reproductive tissue."

The CFR excludes the following from regulation as HCT/Ps: vascularized human organs for transplantation; whole blood or blood components, or derivative products, already regulated as biologics; secreted or extracted human products, such as milk, collagen, and cell factors, except semen; minimally-manipulated bone marrow for homologous use and not combined with another article, with some exceptions; ancillary products used in the manufacture of HCT/P; cells, tissues and organs derived from animals other than humans; in vitro diagnostic products; and blood vessels recovered with an organ that are intended for use in organ transplantation and labeled, "For use in organ transplantation only."

__Stem cells caught in crossfire__

Stem cells are regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research as human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products.

The criteria laid out in 21 CFR 1271.10\(a\) — read Code of Federal Regulations, title 21, part 1271, section 10, paragraph "a" — determine whether or not a stem cell treatment is subject to pre-market review. Products that meet all of the criteria are regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, meaning no pre-market review or FDA application is required.

However, stem cells that do not meet all of the HCT/P criteria are subject to additional layers of regulation as "drugs, devices and/or biological products," under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and/or the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. These treatments would require pre-market approval, Heidi Rebello, FDA Office of Media Affairs’ deputy director of operations, said in an email interview.

"For a stem cell product that does not meet the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361, a Biologics License Application, BLA, would need to be approved before commercial marketing," she said.

To satisfy the HCT/P criteria and avoid the "biological drug" label, stem cell treatments and products must be: no more than minimally manipulated; intended for homologous use only; not combined with another article, except for water, crystalloids, or a sterilizing, preserving or storage agent, provided that the addition of water, crystalloids, or the sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent does not raise new clinical safety concerns; and does not have a systemic effect and is not dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function, or if it does, the stem cells are intended for autologous use or use by a first-or-second-degree blood relative.

The criteria can be frustrating for patients considering treatment options, as well as doctors wanting to develop their own procedures, because of the technical breakdown of the definitions and modifiers within the HCT/P criteria.

The minimal manipulation rule has incited most of the debates and confusion among potential stem cell patients.

The CFR definition of "minimal manipulation" depends on whether the HCT/P is a structural tissue or a nonstructural tissue.

If it is a structural tissue, minimal manipulation means, "processing that does not alter the original relevant characteristics of the tissue relating to the tissue’s utility for reconstruction, repair or replacement."

According to FDA’s "Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Minimal Manipulation of Structural Tissue Jurisdictional Update," a tissue characteristic is "original" if it is present in the tissue in the donor.

A tissue characteristic is "relevant" if it could have a meaningful bearing on how the tissue performs when utilized for reconstruction, repair or replacement. A characteristic of structural tissue would be relevant when it could potentially increase or decrease the utility of the original tissue for reconstruction, repair or replacement.

In 1998, the FDA identified cutting, grinding, shaping, soaking in antibiotic solution, sterilization by gamma irradiation, lyophilization, freezing, and demineralization of bone as appropriate forms of minimal manipulation.

For cells and nonstructural tissue, minimal manipulation means, "processing that does not alter the relevant biological characteristics of cells or tissues."

In 2001, the FDA identified density-gradient separation, cell selection, centrifugation, and cryopreservation as acceptable forms of minimal manipulation.

However, cell expansion in culture — the method used for multiplying most adult stem cell treatments — and human skin processed into human collagen are examples of more than minimal manipulation.

SammyJo Wilkinson, who has received mesenchymal stem cell treatments for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, said an example of minimal manipulation is a "same-day" procedure.

In such a procedure, she said in an email interview, a doctor would conduct a liposuction procedure to obtain adipose tissue, and then centrifuge the cells to isolate the stem cells from the fat — the resulting byproduct is known as stromal vascular fraction. The stromal vascular fraction would then be injected back into the patient.

However, she said, "You only get up to 50 million mesenchymal stem cells — the most important cell type for healing" — that way.

Fifty million sounds like a robust number to most people, but when it comes to stem cells — where doctors can inject hundreds of millions of stem cells during a single visit — 50 million sounds more cute than effective.

Wilkinson received 100 million autologous mesenchymal stem cells through a spinal injection, as well as 200 million autologous mesenchymal stem cells through an intravenous infusion on the same day in May.

Furthermore, Wilkinson said, "the mixture also includes other cell types" whereas more than minimally-manipulated procedures involve "isolating the pure mesenchymal stem cells from fat, storing in \(a cryopreservation\) cell bank for life, and then taking a little bit to grow a large dose of pure mesenchymal stem cells to treat the patient."

The FDA did not respond to minimal manipulation requests.

"Currently, the only stem cell-based products approved for use in the U.S. consist of cord blood-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells — blood forming stem cells — for certain indications," Rebello said.

__FDA redefines autologous stem cells__

While some stem cell advocates have disliked the minimal manipulation rule from its inception, many were able to justify the FDA’s actions. At first, the regulation was only aimed at allogenic — donor — stem cells and did not interfere with using autologous — one’s own — stem cells.

But when the agency "departed from the requirements of notice and comment rulemaking" to quietly — even secretly — make a one-word change in the 2006 Federal Register, it quickly lost its remaining supporters in the stem cell community.

Mary Ann Chirba, professor of legal reasoning, research and writing at Boston College Law School in Newton, Mass., submitted a response to FDA’s "Periodic Reviews of Existing Regulations" in 2011.

In her submission, Chirba writes that the FDA, "Quietly but dramatically changed the basic definition of HCT/Ps that anchors the FDA’s three-tiered, risk-based framework for regulating human cells and tissue products."

"With no notice and absolutely no opportunity for public comment — and, indeed, with no formal announcement beyond its routine, annual publication of regulations — the FDA substantively redefined autologous HCT/Ps by deleting the critical descriptor of transfer into ‘another’ human from the regulation," she writes.

Copies of 21 CFR 1271.3\(d\) — the definition of "human cells, tissues, or cellular, or tissue-based products" — prior to 2006 read, "Articles containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into another \(italics added\) human recipient."

In 2006, the FDA discreetly changed the definition to, "Articles containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a \(italics added\) human recipient."

Chirba writes that by revising the definition, "Without the benefit of public input, the FDA has fashioned a regulation that imposes real and extensive burdens on patients and providers while achieving little if any benefit — at least with regard to low-risk, autologous adult stem cell therapies.

"More specifically, the FDA’s \[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research\] merged two previously distinct categories of products, i.e., autologous and allogenic, into one. In doing so, it removed autologous cells from minimal regulatory 361 oversight and subjected them to 351’s far more rigorous."

By making a one-word change to a CFR definition, the FDA severely limited progress in stem cell therapy.

Now, physicians are regulated the same as large pharmaceutical companies, and patients do not own the rights to their bodies’ cells — the FDA does.
