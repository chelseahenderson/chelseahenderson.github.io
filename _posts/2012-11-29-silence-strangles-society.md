A young woman gets ready for a party. She selects a new blouse with a tailored jacket and her favorite pair of skinny jeans. While walking out the door, she hears the beginning of a news segment. A woman has been raped while jogging a few cities away.

"That’s horrible," she thinks to herself, vowing it will never happen to her.

She grabs her keys and heads to a friend’s house, promising herself she will only stay for a few drinks seeing as she has to wake up early the next morning.

But the night is young, and anything can happen — except the unthinkable.

A few hours later, she returns home, unable to make sense of the evening. She said, "No," but he did it anyway. She fought. And he continued. She tried to leave. He stopped her.

She may think to herself, "I was raped." But that will most likely be followed by, "It was my fault."

Eventually, she will be able to process what has happened to her — what was done to her, by a friend, a boyfriend, a previous lover. But that process of understanding and coming to terms with such a terrible act could take months — or years.

The following stories come from survivors of sexual assault. These women agreed to be interviewed, of their own free will, "to voice the unspeakable and to put a face to the statistics."

__‘Moment of clarity’__

The night began like any other for Brooke Crum. She was hanging out with a group of friends during the summer of 2008, watching TV and drinking. The Dallas native had just completed her first year of college. One of her high school friends needed a ride, and she offered to take him home.

"When we got to his house, he invited me in," Crum said. "I don’t really remember a whole lot after that — luckily — because the next thing I remember is waking up in bed with him and wondering how I got there."

She was 19 years old, in bed with a man she thought was her friend. During sex, she said she experienced a moment of clarity where she thought, "What’s going on?" And then it passed.

"The next thing I remember is waking up in a dark room, wondering where my clothes were," she said. "I tried — desperately — not to wake him up so I could leave — and that was unsuccessful.

"I felt guilty, like I shouldn’t have been drinking. I shouldn’t have gone into his house — all these things I shouldn’t have done. What could I have done differently to stop this?

"I remember going home and taking a very long shower and just forgetting about it — even trying to make light of it. I was in a lot of pain. I told my friends, but I always framed it as something that was consensual when it really wasn’t. Because I thought it was my fault."

Crum said she did her best to put the incident out of her mind. But a year later, she found herself in a similar situation.

She was drinking at a friend’s house with a group of people. She had to wake up at 5 a.m. the following day, so she decided to stay there.

"As soon as everyone left, he came onto me," Crum said. "I remember kissing him, and I thought it was nice. But the next thing I remember is him carrying me into his bedroom, and I don’t remember anything after that.

"Again, there was that moment of clarity where it was like I was waking up — and then it faded. The next thing I remember is waking up and, again, wondering where my clothes were."

The following morning, Crum had a conversation she will never forget.

"I remember having to ask him, ‘Did you use a condom?’ And his answer was not straightforward," she said. "I didn’t confront him. I just left. I went home and took a shower, as if I could wash it away."

For weeks, Crum worried she might be pregnant. When she missed her period, she began to weigh her options.

"There was no way I could have supported a child," Crum said. "I was not working. I was going to school full time. I was in a brand-new city, brand-new world, and there was no way I could have done it on my own. I had three years left of school, and then I was done. If I had had a kid, there’s no way I could have finished in three years.

"My only options were abortion or adoption, and having to go through a pregnancy was not something I could put my body — or my mind — through and not keep that child. That was just something I could not endure. So I was left with the option of abortion — which, of course, I did not want to do. But my other choices weren’t feasible, so if that’s what I had to do to maintain what I saw for a future for myself, that was what I was going to do."

Crum took two home pregnancy tests, which came out negative, but decided to go get checked at Planned Parenthood when she continued to miss her period.

"They tested me again and said it was negative," she said. "A nurse told me that she had had a similar situation and that it was just stress. She told me to take it easy — that I would eventually start."

Crum told a few friends after the first assault, but said she always made light of it since she didn’t fully understand what happened to her. She didn’t tell anyone after the second assault until it began affecting her school.

"At intervals, I couldn’t even go to class," Crum said. "I was just so scared, crying at random intervals. I didn’t even tell my best friend until I thought I was pregnant. I remember her bringing me to class and dropping me off, and I just started crying in her car. She, somehow, had suspected. She told me it would be OK and we would figure it out."

For years, Crum continued to believe that the assaults were her fault.

"I didn’t really think of it as rape," she said. "The script we are given about rape on TV and in the mainstream is this stranger that crawls into your bedroom window at night. It’s the guy who comes at you when you’re jogging in the dark. It’s like ‘Law and Order: SVU.’

"But men are given that script, too. In all the movies, you see it — like in ‘Superbad.’ ‘Get her drunk and have sex with her.’ That’s the script. That’s a rite of passage."

Crum began to see the "script" as a "sham" in spring 2011, when she was enrolled in "Sex, Society and Ethics" at Texas Christian University.

"We read a lot of articles about rape," she said, "and one of them was talking about the difference between wanting to have sex and consenting to sex. That’s something that no one ever talks about when they talk about rape. And me, being a young, healthy person, of course, I wanted to have sex. That’s just a natural thing. I just felt like I shouldn’t have wanted it. I shouldn’t have wanted to have sex. That doesn’t mean that I wanted to have sex with those people — because I didn’t. That was just a distinction I had never made.

"It really made me want to talk about these things, made me want to pay attention to them. It’s hard to read it, it’s hard to go through it, and it’s hard to listen to it. But as hard as it is, we need to hear it. It’s got to end."

Crum never reported the assaults.

"The first time, I really didn’t consider it to be rape," she said. "The second time, I didn’t think he was a bad guy. I didn’t know if he deserved to go to jail for that or be punished for it. I don’t even know if he knows it’s wrong.

"But \(I also didn’t go to the police\) because reporting that crime is just like reliving it, and not in a therapeutic way like now, where it’s helping me talk about it and be open about it so that I can overcome it. It’s just like a judgment. You’re forever stigmatized."

Crum has received therapy for the assaults. The only thing left, she said, is to tell her parents. After the assaults, she was worried they wouldn’t understand.

"I guess a part of it is shame — worrying that they would blame me," she said. "But I didn’t want them to worry. I didn’t want them to blame themselves, because it’s not their fault. It’s not my fault. It’s those men’s fault."

Now 24, Crum works and lives in Port Arthur. She said she decided to use her real name for this article so she could stop hiding from the attacks.

"It’s important that people know that they can talk to me," she said. "It’s part of opening myself up to discussion. It is part of not shaming myself, and just talking about it. It’s being like, ‘Look this happened to me. It’s part of who I am, and it’s not going away.’ I want to deal with it so it does not rule me. It has changed me — but it does not define me."

__‘Is that what you had on?’__

When "Jane" and her family returned to their Houston home in 1991, she noticed the alarm did not go off. She assumed one of the kids hadn’t set it on their way out earlier that day. She got onto them for being careless, sent everyone off for showers, and they all went to bed.

"Jane" slept in a bedroom toward the front of the house. Her niece and her newborn, as well as Jane’s young boys slept in the back part of the house.

But someone else was in the house that night. He could have been hiding in one of the bathrooms, pantries or closets while the family got ready for bed. He made his move once everyone was asleep.

"When I woke up, he was on me with his hands around my neck and his leg in between my legs," Jane said. "He said that if I screamed or hollered, he would go in and do something to my niece. I didn’t scream, but I hurt him pretty good.

"He’ll always remember me. He has a scar from \(the top of his neck to the top of his chest\). When I was able to get loose enough to get him, I grabbed something off the side of my bed and just \(slashed and struck\), and I kept kicking him in his private parts."

Jane contacted the police as soon as her attacker left — with her car. As he was leaving, she recognized his voice.

"When the police came, I told them who I thought it was," she said. "It was someone that lived in our neighborhood. They got him for stealing my car, but they also got him for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. It took maybe four or five days. Evidently, he told them that I let him have my car. The Devil is alive."

Jane didn’t want the neighborhood to know that she was raped, but she told the deputies and officers that came to her house.

"Some of the police officers — their questions," she said, with a pause. "\(Before they arrived\), I got in the shower, and I just scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed. But when they got there, \(an officer\) was like, ‘What the heck did you do that for?’"

The same officer saw Jane’s gown lying on her bed and asked, "Is that what you had on?"

"I often worry that they will ask rape victims those kinds of questions," she said. "It doesn’t matter what you have on. You could walk into a room full of people butt naked — if you say, ‘No,’ no means no."

Jane agreed to go to the hospital for an exam, but rode in an officer’s private car so that her neighbors wouldn’t know what was going on.

"They knew something happened, but all they knew was that my car was gone. The guy’s mom — they lived two houses from me — when she found out he stole my car, she made a comment that I’ll always remember — \(that\) he was obsessed with me.

"And I used to look at her like, ‘All of these pretty white girls in this neighborhood, why would he be obsessed with me?’"

Jane, who is African American, said it didn’t make any sense, because his father didn’t like black people — "and he let us know."

Jane was in her 30s when she was raped in her home, but she was already a rape survivor. She was a freshman in college, just 17 years old, when the first assault occurred.

"It was date rape," she said. "Somebody heard me scream, so before it even happened good, it stopped. It was just the idea that somebody would try to do that to you — the idea that I didn’t really mean no. I’m like, ‘The hell I didn’t.’

"I was angry, and I just really wanted to hurt him. For a while, if someone touched me, I would \(jump\), and if a guy touched me, it was like, ‘Oh, my God.’ The only guy that could touch me was my \(track\) coach. If I had to be wrapped and a girl wasn’t there, my coach was the only person that could wrap my legs. And for a long time after that — some years — I always jumped when somebody touched me."

Jane continued to shy away from people after the assault at her house. She stopped wearing shorts and began wearing warm-up pants and floor-length skirts. She hid her body for a long time.

"One day, my pastor’s wife said, ‘You’ve got to come out of this.’ That’s when I put myself in the hospital for a psych evaluation," she said.

Jane taught ceramics classes while in treatment, helping others work through their depression.

"It was like I went there for something other than what I thought I went there for," she said. "But the depression was there, and then I learned how to cope with it and work through it. That’s how that became what I needed to do — to help other people. It was something bad that God turned to good for me."

Since then, Jane has dedicated herself to helping victims of rape and other crimes. She has been a licensed and ordained minister for 14 years.

Now in her 50s, Jane is a Lamar University faculty member. She decided to remain anonymous for this article in order to avoid the social stigmas of being a crime victim, she said.

__‘We live in a rape culture’__

One out of every four women is the victim of rape or attempted rape, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Of those women, one in four will report the assault. Eighty-four percent will know their attacker, approximately 57 percent will happen while on dates, and about 42 percent will tell no one.

"We live in a rape culture, because we have one of the highest rape rates in the world," Jennifer Fagen, Lamar associate sociology professor said. "But if you look at the conviction rate, you’ll find that at a much lower number, because it is the most under-reported crime in the U.S. That’s why it’s referred to as a rape culture."

Fagen said there are multiple factors that affect why so many choose not to report rape — besides the physical and psychological trauma — including "rape myths" and the belief in traditional gender roles.

"The rape myths are that women are asking for it, women say no when they mean yes, women’s clothing is indicative of their morality or their willingness to have sex with someone — that women shouldn’t be alone or else they are vulnerable to a sexual attack," she said. "Another myth is that men cannot control themselves, sexually — that once men are aroused, they can’t stop."

Fagen said that the more men and women believe in traditional gender roles, the more likely they are to buy into the rape myths. Men will be more inclined to think, "She wanted it," and women will be more inclined to believe they were "asking for it."

"There’s no such thing as a woman asking for sex unless she verbalizes it," she scoffed. "And then some people don’t know that you can say no at any point, and the man or woman — whoever is being sexually aggressive — has to stop."

Rape is one of the only crimes where the victim must prove he or she did not consent, Fagen said.

"If someone robs you, you don’t have to prove that it wasn’t consensual — that you let this stranger borrow your TV," she said. "The problem is that because our conception of heterosexual sex is asymmetrical, it’s very hard to tell the difference between rape and consensual sex.

"Because the former is imbued with violence, and the latter is also asymmetrical —which is the hallmark of rape, asymmetrical sexuality — one person being the initiator, or aggressive, and the other person being passive. They look very similar in some people’s eyes. 

"That doesn’t mean heterosexual sex is like rape, or it’s violent, or it’s aggressive. It just means that’s how our culture has constructed it."

America’s rape culture has infiltrated everyday slang, which further blurs the lines between consensual and non-consensual sex, Fagen said.

"All of the phrases we use as euphemisms for regular heterosexual sex all have two things in common," she said. "They imply violence, or at least an asymmetrical heterosexuality, and they posit women as the sexual object and men as the sexual subject.

"The most basic would be the, ‘hit that, tap that, smash that.’ And in all of those cases, the ‘that,’ or the object, is the woman. But she’s not referred to as a human being. And the person doing the hitting, smashing, knocking, tapping, is always the male."

Another deterrent to reporting rape is that most attacks don’t look like those depicted on the movie screen, Fagen said.

"Date rape is the most common type of rape," she said. "It’s someone you typically went out with, consensually, so it’s hard for people to separate it. It’s not the stranger jumping out of the bushes. 

"So women are embarrassed people will think they’re promiscuous, or they’re embarrassed people will think they caused it — and they may even think that they caused it. But the men who rape are indistinguishable from other men in other characteristics. They’re not monsters. They’re average guys."

__‘We’ve got to do it together’__

The nation’s rape culture will remain until society, as a whole, takes active steps toward correcting itself. But the problem needs to be treated at the source.

"We shouldn’t be targeting women when it comes to rape prevention programs," Fagen said. "We should target the people who are doing most of the rapes.

"We have to deconstruct the gender dichotomy, because when you create someone who seems like they’re the opposite of you, it’s easier to harm them. We’ve done that to every group we’ve oppressed in society. We’ve considered them less human than we are. Once you feel people are human to the same degree as you are, you don’t hurt them."

"Jane" said that society must realize there is a problem before it can rebuild. Victims must stop shaming themselves and take their power back so their voices can be heard.

"A lot of them feel like it’s their fault — and the guilt is what kills them," she said. "You have to forgive yourself. Then you have to do a really hard thing — and forgive that person. Until you forgive yourself and that person, you’re still in that bondage.

"Once you do that, get help. Don’t just go to your friends. Get help from somebody that knows about it, somebody that’s gone through it and has healed from it, somebody that has the power to be able to help you — and if that’s a doctor or a psychiatrist, then do that. Support groups are really good, because you can talk it out. When you give voice to something, when you talk about it and break the silence, then you heal quicker."

Crum agreed that victims shouldn’t keep their "toxic" experience to themselves.

"We have to talk about it, and learn from it," she said. "Maybe you’ll realize how strong you are or how beautiful you are — how much power you really do have. Why else would someone want to take it away from you?

"I fear for young women, and I just hope that they know that the only reason that rape is so prevalent is because they have so much to offer. For all the women who have been raped, and have chosen to go on, it’s a beautiful thing. 

"Women are strong, amazing individuals, and we can come out of this long night stronger. But we’ve got to do it together."
