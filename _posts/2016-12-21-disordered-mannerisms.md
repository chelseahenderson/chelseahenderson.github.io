__Disordered \(man\)nerisms__

Published on Feb\. 26, 2010 in University Press

*Editor’s note: This is the third installment of a three\-part series on eating disorders\.*

Eating disorders are considered to be a feminine disease\. Celebrities like Karen Carpenter have cemented the idea that some women will literally kill themselves to be thin\. The world can watch as Lindsay Lohan's ribs become more prominent and the Olsen twins wear bigger and bigger clothes to hide their various protruding bones\.

With a majority of the media attention and expectations focused on women, people often forget that men also battle anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and overeating\. At least one million boys and men in the United States are struggling with eating disorders, according to Eating Disorders Awareness and Prevention, Inc\.

“It almost seems like it's expected for a girl to do it, and it's kind of heresy, blasphemy or frowned upon for a guy to do it,” said 17\-year\-old “Ryan,” who requested an alias so that he could talk about his disorder honestly without being judged by his parents or peers\.

“It dethrones you,” he said\. “It seems like it's taking away your manhood, because guys are not so crucial about their appearance as girls are\. As for me, I've always been one who cares about my looks, who's always been very hygienic — hopefully I always smell good\. I just care about my physical self, because in my opinion, your outer body should reflect your inner body\.”

Ryan “gave in” to bulimia when he was 14\-years\-old\. He said he purged at least once a day for a year and a half\.

“It's going to sound very cliché and stupid, but it was the classic case of you like this girl and realize you're not in any way attractive,” he said\. “Of course, it never worked out with that one girl, but I always thought, back when I was young, that if you had a good body you could get girls easy\. Little did I know you also had to have a personality\.

“You see all your attractive friends going with girls and coming back and saying, 'I did this,' and you go, 'I remember that time when\.\.\. no I don't\. I remember that time on Runescape one night, me and this girl were having a saucy conversation\. She was a level 67 Ranger\.'”

Ryan said he considers it a weakness and doesn't like people seeing him in that light\.

“There's multiple other things I choose not to share with people about myself, but then again there's a lot of other things that I throw out there; this was one of those things I did not want to be in the public light,” he said\. “Personally, I don't think it's low\. It's more of people's stigma against it\. I don't want people to see me as 'that person\.' I think when people find out that \(others\) are like that, they shy away from them; they think they're weird\. They treat them as if they have a disease, and I didn't want to be treated like that\. That's kind of the entire opposite direction I was trying to go from starting it in the beginning\.”

Ryan said that low self\-esteem played a role in his disorder\.

“I'd convinced myself I wasn't good enough,” he said\. “I mean everybody spends almost their entire life trying to get people to like them\. But when you convince yourself that you're not good enough for even yourself, it's just low\.”

A 19\-year\-old Texas A&M freshman from Beaumont, whose name has been changed to “Kevin,” to preserve his anonymity, has struggled with body image issues for years, beginning in high school\. He describes himself as a “borderline anorexic\.”

“It wasn't like I didn't eat constantly\. Just every few weeks I would decide to not eat very much because I felt fat,” Kevin said\. “I don't like my stomach; it has muscle, but I'm still fat\. I went a whole week without eating because I wanted to lose weight\. It wasn't the best idea; I almost passed out\.”

Kevin was active in many sports before he graduated high school, competing in soccer for 15 years, baseball for 12 years, wrestling and cross country for three years, and track for two years\.

“I didn't do it for the sports more or less,” he said\. “I did it because I thought I was fat\. I weighed 152 pounds and had to lose seven pounds to get down to \(a wrestling weight of\) 145\. Weighing less is always better; I looked fat\. I didn't want to eat so that I could make a guarantee that I wouldn't gain weight\. I associated food with getting fat\. It's easier to not eat; I didn't feel like doing work, as in working out to lose weight\. Sometimes it was just not worth it to get food\.”

Kevin said he always “starved” the day before and the morning of a weigh\-in for wrestling\. After he made weight, he said he would eat a little, compete and then eat “something little like a sandwich\.” He said that until he went a week without eating, starving never affected his performance in any of his sports\.

“It got kind of bad toward the end of the week, but for the first three or four days I felt fine,” he said\. “I don't understand how my body works; it just tells me what to do\. My brain told me to not eat\. My body tries to tell me what to do, and I put it in its place\.”

Kevin said that no one ever noticed because he looked “normal\.” He asked for an alias so that his father wouldn't find out and his coaches wouldn't get in any kind of trouble\.

Until this interview, Ryan said he had never told anyone about his problems with his weight, self\-image and the lengths he took to make himself more “attractive\.”

“I'm sure people had their suspicions, but people don't really expect it coming from a guy,” Ryan said\. “At the same time, it was good to be alienated from people\. \(I would throw up\) mostly at my home or anyplace I'd feel comfortable\. I would do it in public, but it'd have to be the individual bathroom; I wouldn't do it if it had stalls\. I didn't need people to cover for me\. At 14 and 15, I didn't really have any friends; that's the sad thing about it\.

“I wouldn't do it when people were around\. If you go out to eat someplace and eat a fattening meal, you go home and do it\. If you had a big dinner at home, you turn on the shower so no one could hear and then do it\. I wouldn't do it at other people's houses; it'd be too obvious\.”

Ryan said that his disorder became addictive, but he tried to limit his purging to once a day\. He would act on his disorder more depending on what he ate, not how he was feeling that day\.

“If there was fast food involved, there was no question about it,” he said\.

Throwing up at least once a day gave Ryan frequent bouts of dizziness and weakness\. He said that constantly throwing up stomach acid made his throat burn, and he noticed a decent amount of blood in his vomit a few months after he started\.

“It wasn't like after a vampire's dinner or anything like that, but it wasn't like droplets,” Ryan said\. “It happened every maybe couple of times this week, maybe this entire week, stuff like that\. It's not like it happened every day\. I think that's kind of what worried me the most\. I didn't want anything to be wrong with my teeth; they took a lot of work\.”

Ryan and Kevin don't participate in their eating disorders anymore\. Kevin is given mandatory meals as part of the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M\.

“In the mornings we're usually pretty hungry,” Kevin said\. “Eating after that much exercise and being destroyed that much is not a good idea\. They give us two meals\.”

Ryan said he stopped gradually as he got busier and had less time to think about his disorder\. It's still a recurring thought now, but he doesn't participate in his disorder anymore\.

“I still think about doing it, but I want to be healthy at the same time,” he said\. “It's not the most healthy thing to do\. At the same time I'd love to have a great, clean body and I don't know if it's worth it\. Granted, it's a lot worse for other people who have become addicted to it or have a need to do it, but I was just never like that\.

“There was a time when I was, but I grew out of it as time drew by\. I realized that it was a real stupid thing to do because of the ramifications of what can happen, whether it be something as simple as losing a tooth and maybe looking like a hillbilly, or something as bad as ending up in the hospital\.”
