__Witches in New Orleans__

Voodoo tourist attractions hold little appeal for authentic pagans, Craft practitioners

Published on April 25, 2013 in UPbeat

“Voodoo\! Voodoo\! Get your Voodoo\! We’ve got Voodoo dolls\! We’ve got gris\-gris bags\! Voodoo\! Voodoo\! Get your Voodoo\!”

I rolled my eyes as my husband and I walked past a barrage of shouted advertisements for various tourist Voodoo shops in downtown New Orleans\. We were making our way through the French Quarter, searching for a shop we’d stumbled upon the night before\.

We weaved in and out of boisterous, drunken groups, maneuvered the one\-way streets and faulty crosswalk signs, and avoided every “tour” offered — on just about every corner, groups of men offered haunted house tours, vampire tours, zombie tours, ghost tours, and, yes, Voodoo tours\.

As we turned the corner onto our desired street, the smell of alcohol slowly faded away\. The shouts of men trying to lure potential customers inside their shops grew quieter, until their incessant chants were no longer audible\.

Flocks of visitors were replaced by families walking dogs, pushing children in strollers and casually sipping coffee on their apartment patios\. The street was a peaceful, quiet gem of normality in an otherwise crowded, loud, tourist attraction\.

We spotted the shop and slowed our pace\. I crossed my fingers as we approached, hoping that it would turn out to be a genuine shop and not another cheesy establishment\.

The weathered sign hanging above the entrance — a hand\-painted red ankh that read “Esoterica Occult Goods” — would look promising to any practicing pagan\. 

Still, I was afraid of being disappointed\. But I came with a mission — to find a real occult shop so I could restock my home apothecary and, hopefully, find some items that aren’t available in Southeast Texas\.

I looked at my husband, took a few deep breaths and stepped inside\. The harsh rays of the sun filtered through the open doorway, gently illuminating the front half of the shop\. As my eyes adjusted to the semi\-darkness, a figure became visible toward the back of the building\. At first, I could only make out the general shape of a woman behind a counter\. As she came into focus, I noticed her slick, jet\-black ponytail with bangs covering her forehead, and a welcoming smile adorned with deep\-red lipstick\.

She didn’t say a word — just stared at us across the room with piercing eyes\. She was feeling us out\.

I felt her watching us as we looked around the cluttered establishment\. Miniature cauldrons, mortar and pestle sets, adorable Cthulu plush toys, ritual candles, essential oils, occult books, and general “hocus pocus” items — at least, that’s what the sign said — led the eye in a circle around a glass case with athames\.

“Yes,” I thought\. “This is a real pagan shop\.”

As we walked the circle, I grabbed items from my mental shopping list and clutched them to my chest\. We walked the circle a few more times — in such a tight space with so many items available, I didn’t want to miss anything\.

I probably noticed it the third time around\. In the back of the shop, behind a glass counter housing jewelry and pendants, the shopkeeper guarded a half\-wall of herbs — the shop apothecary\. My eyes lit up immediately\.

For a \(mostly\) green witch, finding a good\-sized apothecary is the metaphorical “kid\-in\-a\-candy\-store” situation\. The shopkeeper must have liked what she saw\.

“Hi\. I’m Lady Mimi,” she said, extending her arm for a handshake\. “Welcome to Esoterica\.”

Sensing that I wouldn’t be able to stay focused long enough to read the labels on all of her glass jars, she handed me a sheet of paper — her store’s herbal inventory, in alphabetical order\.

I beamed at her, scanning the list in my hands\.

She reached for a stepladder behind the counter and placed it in the center of the shelves of herbs\. Taking the first step up, she looked at me over her shoulder, smiled, and said, “Go\!”

As I went down the list, calling out the herbs I wanted, she seamlessly pulled jars to the front of the shelves — like a seasoned librarian pulls the correct books without even looking\.

When I finished calling out names, she looked at me again and asked, “Are you sure?”

Of course, she was right\. I had missed two\.

“I thought so,” she said, laughing, as she pulled two more jars forward\.

I was truly finished\. She took the requested jars down one\-by\-one, removing pre\-weighed Ziploc bags and tossing them to the counter as she put the jars back in their spots\.

“What else do you need, honey?” she asked\.

“Can I have a look at those athames?” I requested\.

She proudly walked from behind the counter to the glass case in the center of the store\. She pulled one out and handed it to me\. Feeling its heavy weight in my hand, I shook my head, “No\.” She nodded and grabbed the one I was eying earlier\. This one, a tapered Egyptian style, was perfect for my ceremonial purposes\.

All total, we must have spent an hour and a half with Lady Mimi on our first visit of the day\. She had a fairly large mortar and pestle set I had my eye on that we ended up going back for later\. Then, of course, I fell in love with the shop all over again and found some other items I had missed the first time around\.

Lady Mimi was phenomenal\. A true witch, she knew to be wary of my husband and me when we walked in\. When it comes to witchcraft and magick, many who show interest end up simply being tourists of the Craft — it’s exciting and different at first, but they end up returning to what’s familiar\. A true witch must sort out the tourists from true practitioners\.

We may have been new to New Orleans, but by no means are we new to the Craft\. And while much of the French Quarter is geared toward Voodoo\-seeking tourists, authentic witchcraft can be found\.

Back in Southeast Texas, my supplies are once again running low\. I’ve got my eye on a boline Lady Mimi has listed online, which means it’s time for another New Orleans trip\.

This time, there will be no misguided searches anywhere near the loud, smelly antics of Bourbon Street — we know exactly where to go\.
