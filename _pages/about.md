# About Chelsea Henderson

I was made to be a journalist — to tell other people's stories. At one point during an advanced journalism writing class, my boss likened me to a "human pen," and that’s the standard I’ve compared myself to ever since.

I have no apprehensions against turning around a hard-news story, but my true passion is old-school interpretive and investigative journalism. I enjoy writing series and features that prompt research, exploration and analysis.
